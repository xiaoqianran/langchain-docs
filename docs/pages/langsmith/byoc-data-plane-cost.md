# AWS data plane cost estimate

Rough AWS cost of a LangSmith BYOC data plane, with a ClickHouse footprint and SmithDB node, metastore, and storage estimates.

<Warning>
  These are estimates, not a quote. AWS changes its prices without notice. Your bill depends on region, usage, and any discount agreement with AWS, such as an Enterprise Discount Program or a Savings Plan.
</Warning>

This is a rough monthly cost for a LangSmith data plane in your AWS account.

<Note>
  Scaling capacity for any resource can be lowered when required, as long as the deployment remains within safe operating limits. For cost-conscious or pre-production deployments, Multi-AZ can be turned off. That lowers monthly cost but reduces fault tolerance.
</Note>

  <Tab title="ClickHouse">
    ClickHouse can also run as a single node instead of a replicated cluster. That lowers monthly cost but reduces fault tolerance.

    | Area | Rough monthly estimate | Notes |
    | - | - | - |
    | RDS PostgreSQL | \$100–\$150 | `db.t4g.medium`, Multi-AZ, 50 GB starting storage. |
    | ElastiCache Redis | \$140–\$280 | Lower end without read replicas. Higher end if read replicas are enabled. |
    | EKS control plane | \~\$75 | One EKS cluster at standard hourly pricing. |
    | System node group | \~\$210 | 3 `m6i.large` on-demand nodes. |
    | Application, ClickHouse, and ZooKeeper worker nodes | \$1,000–\$1,500 | LangSmith pods and ClickHouse pods. |
    | EBS volumes | \$200–\$350 | ClickHouse, ZooKeeper, node volumes, and gp3 performance settings. |
    | Networking | \$150–\$300 | NAT gateways, load balancers, PrivateLink or VPC endpoints, and low-volume data processing. |
    | S3, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch | \$50–\$200 | Low-volume baseline. Grows with trace payloads, logs, and retention. |

    Estimated monthly total: **\$1,925–\$3,065**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="SmithDB">
    By default, SmithDB runs the Small tier from [Configure SmithDB for scale](/langsmith/self-host-smithdb-scale): about 10 runs per second and 10 queries per second. LangSmith increases that tier as tracing volume requires it.

    <Warning>
      After the SmithDB migration, ClickHouse and ZooKeeper are scaled down. If cost is a concern, ClickHouse can be turned off. That lowers monthly cost but reduces reliability, because there is no ClickHouse fallback.
    </Warning>

    | Area | Rough monthly estimate | Notes |
    | - | - | - |
    | RDS PostgreSQL | \$100–\$150 | `db.t4g.medium`, Multi-AZ, 50 GB starting storage. |
    | ElastiCache Redis | \$140–\$280 | Lower end without read replicas. Higher end if read replicas are enabled. |
    | EKS control plane | \~\$75 | One EKS cluster at standard hourly pricing. |
    | System node group | \~\$210 | 3 `m6i.large` on-demand nodes. |
    | Application, ClickHouse, and ZooKeeper worker nodes | \$650 | Scaled down ClickHouse costs. |
    | EBS volumes | \$200–\$350 | ClickHouse, ZooKeeper, node volumes, and gp3 performance settings. Lower once those volumes shrink. |
    | Networking | \$150–\$300 | NAT gateways, load balancers, PrivateLink or VPC endpoints, and low-volume data processing. |
    | S3, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch | \$50–\$200 | Low-volume baseline. Grows with trace payloads, logs, and retention. |
    | SmithDB compute | \$1,550 | 2 x `m7gd.4xlarge` across two availability zones, plus a 100 GiB gp3 boot volume on each node. |
    | SmithDB metastore | \$210 | Aurora PostgreSQL 18 Serverless v2, writer and reader, 1 ACU minimum, 50 GB. |
    | SmithDB bucket | \$5–\$120 | S3 storage costs, would largely be dictated by trace payload size and retention. |

    Estimated monthly total: **\$3,340–\$4,095**

    ### SmithDB object store pricing

    | Stored size per trace | 14-day retention | 400-day retention |
    | - | - | - |
    | 10 KB | \$2 per year | \$74 per year |
    | 50 KB | \$15 per year | \$368 per year |
    | 200 KB | \$52 per year | \$1,472 per year |

    A [ClickHouse backfill](/langsmith/self-host-smithdb-migrate) needs an extra `m7gd.4xlarge` for the migration job at about **\$24 per day**. That cost stops when the backfill finishes (Job finishes in a few days depending on tracing volume).

    See [Prepare SmithDB supporting infrastructure](/langsmith/self-host-smithdb-infrastructure) for details of SmithDB infrastructure.
