      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Tracing

      * The LangSmith MCP adds a `query_runs` tool that accepts the same parameters as the SDK's `client.runs.query()`, including typed `selects` for costs, token breakdowns, and full inputs and outputs, with cursor pagination. It returns token counts and USD costs by default. `fetch_runs` now also returns costs and token counts, and is deprecated in favor of `query_runs`.
      * Costs now resolve for every OpenAI model on the pricing page, including those listed only under "All models", such as GPT-5.6 Luna and Terra. The daily price sync previously read only the models the page shows by default, so the rest kept stale prices. [Learn more](/langsmith/cost-tracking).
      * Costs now resolve for the open models Vertex AI hosts through Model-as-a-Service: DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Kimi, MiniMax, and GPT-OSS. [Learn more](/langsmith/cost-tracking).
      * The Messages view now shows the user message on OpenAI Responses API calls that send it as a plain string, which is how calls chained with `previous_response_id` or a conversation send each new turn.
      * The Messages view requests smaller pages, so long threads no longer fail with a response size error.
      * When a trace or thread filter fails, LangSmith shows the error below the filter and keeps the selected run details open, so you can edit or clear the filter without leaving the page.
      * Creating a public trace or thread share link now requires permission to read the runs, including their inputs and outputs.
      * The LangSmith Chat model picker now offers Claude Sonnet 5.5. Sonnet 5 stays the default.
      * LangSmith Chat can now take about four times as many steps in one turn, so a large custom app build finishes instead of ending with a "Recursion limit of 250 reached" error.
      * Chat on a Gemini 3.x model through Vertex AI now completes turns that call several tools in a row.
      * Apps that LangSmith Chat builds now page through lists such as annotation queue items instead of showing only the first page.
      * Sorting tracing projects by **Most Recent Run** now orders projects whose runs reference dataset examples by their latest run, instead of grouping them with empty projects.

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * LLM-as-a-judge evaluators using Claude Opus 5.5 or Sonnet 5.5 on Amazon Bedrock no longer fail because of unsupported forced tool choice.
      * Creating an evaluator now selects the default evaluator model preset from model settings, including LangSmith Gateway presets.
      * Clicking **Test** on a thread or trajectory evaluator now shows export and validation failures instead of appearing to do nothing. Evaluator tests also show configuration errors, such as a missing endpoint URL, in the evaluator panel.
      * Deleting a code evaluator no longer times out waiting for sandbox snapshot cleanup.
      * Experiment run progress now reflects recorded runs when available, rather than only settled batches.
      * **Add to dataset** now saves the full source run metadata, and metadata you supply is merged with the run's metadata instead of replacing it.
      * Replacing a dataset's examples with `PUT /v1/platform/datasets/{dataset_id}/examples` succeeds again when the request updates existing examples.
      * LLM-as-a-judge evaluators whose prompt carries both an old and a current output schema now check scores against the schema the judge uses, so scores are saved under the right feedback keys.

      ### Feedback

      * Runs opened in an annotation queue now show the same top bar as runs in tracing, so annotators can switch between the Trajectory and Details views while reviewing.
      * Annotation queue instructions keep their line breaks in the review side panel, so multi-line and list-style instructions display as written.
      * Adding a run to a dataset from an annotation queue now saves your edits when the output is a single message, and shows an error if the example cannot be created.

      ### Prompts and playground

      * GPT-6.1-Sol is available and selected by default for new OpenAI prompts in the Playground and new model configurations.
      * Claude Sonnet 5.5 is available in the Playground and model configurations for Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, and Vertex AI.
      * Gemini 3.7 Flash and Gemini 3.8 Flash are available in the Google Gemini and Vertex AI model selectors.
      * The LangSmith MCP's `get_prompt_by_name` now returns the prompt template. New tools let agents push prompt versions, browse commits, manage commit tags, update or delete prompts, and read and commit Context Hub agent and skill files.
      * Editing a Context Hub webhook now loads its saved custom headers, so saving no longer overwrites them.
      * Loading a saved Bedrock Converse configuration whose model ID is an application inference profile ARN now keeps the provider set in **Extra Parameters**.

      ### Engine

      * Engine usage, spend limits, and pricing now display in LangChain Standard Units (LSUs), priced at \$1 each. Dollar amounts are unchanged. [Learn more](/langsmith/engine#manage-engine-costs).
      * Issue validation requests its judgment as a tool call, so a failed structured-output response no longer aborts the run.
      * Engine projects that previously selected Skills for Coding Agents now use standard issue analysis, with scan cadence based on their configured analysis level.
      * Engine project boards no longer show the floating feedback survey.

      ## Deployment

      * Agents connected to LangSmith's native MCP server can find deployments and revisions and read build or runtime logs, filtered by revision, time, search text, and severity. Deployment summaries omit secrets and environment configuration.
      * The revision line on a deployment's **Overview** tab shows the commit title, links to the commit on GitHub, and shows the exact time in your local time zone. A failed revision reads "Build failed" or "Deploy failed", with the full error a click away.
      * Deployment log API entries now say whether a line came from the API server, a queue worker, the build, or the platform, which replica wrote it, and selected fields of structured JSON log lines such as run and thread IDs.
      * Studio's thread sidebar and the deployment **Threads** tab request only the fields they display, so lists load for deployments whose threads previously exceeded the Agent Server response size limit.
      * Searching server or build logs for text that contains quotes or backslashes now returns matching lines instead of an "Invalid or expired offset" error. Log searches are limited to 1,000 characters.
      * Server and build logs for deployments hosted on AWS now list the most recent lines first when sorted newest first.
      * The deployment **Overview** tab no longer shows a Postgres disk usage banner. Disk usage is still charted on the **Monitoring** tab.

      ## Sandboxes

      * The LangSmith MCP can read, write, and search sandbox files, stream long-running sandbox commands, share sandbox ports behind LangSmith login, and report sandbox usage, organization usage, audit logs, usage limits, trace retention settings, and organization members.
      * Sandbox proxy rules accept `match_headers` entries such as `"authorization: Bearer account-b"`, so several rules on one host can each swap a different placeholder for its own credential and serve multiple accounts.
      * A memory-preserving sandbox that was snapshotted while running now resumes with all of its memory after its next stop and start.
      * A brief storage backend error no longer leaves a sandbox's filesystem returning I/O errors until restart.

      ## Administration

      * OAuth applications registered under **Settings** > **OAuth applications** can use one access token for both the LangSmith API and the Remote MCP server, instead of authorizing each separately.
      * Calls through LangSmith Managed Tools now appear in audit logs as `invoke_mcp_server` or `invoke_mcp_gateway`, with the server or gateway and the tool called. Audit log entries also include the request's duration and user agent.
      * Search organization and workspace settings from the keyboard, and open **Settings** with Command + comma on Mac or Ctrl + comma on Windows and Linux.
      * Search permissions by group, name, or identifier in role previews and the role editor.
      * Usage charts and CSV exports keep historical usage when billing metrics change and hide metrics with no usage.
      * Sign-up and login retries no longer carry stale authentication errors into their return URLs.

      ### LLM Gateway

      * Route ScaleDown requests through the LLM Gateway with your workspace's `SCALEDOWN_API_KEY`. Native compression, extraction, classification, decisions, summarization, and batch APIs keep their request and response formats.
      * The LLM Gateway applies existing custom provider fallback policies when you call a saved model configuration through a unified endpoint. Explicit model configuration policies take precedence.
      * The LLM Gateway now accepts a Responses `function_call_output` whose output is an array of text parts. Gemini and other translated providers previously returned a 400 on this form, which broke MCP tool results sent by LangChain.
      * Fallback chain model selectors show **Workspace** or **Organization** badges for custom model configurations.
    </Update>

    <Update label="September 21-28, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Tracing

      * The Trajectory view is available to everyone, with turn navigation, expandable messages, and consistent trace details.
      * The tracing quickstart and guided onboarding now cover Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, VS Code Copilot, and Cursor, with plugin installs and environment setup generated for your project and region. [Learn more](/langsmith/trace-claude-code).
      * Gemini runs now report cost regardless of which SDK traced them. Previously, Gemini calls traced through clients other than `google_genai` showed no cost. [Learn more](/langsmith/cost-tracking).
      * Traces can now contain up to 100,000 runs.
      * Revamped tracing filters are available whenever SmithDB queries are enabled, without a separate feature flag.
      * The **Error** column shows error descriptions directly in the trace table again.
      * The trace **Tools** tab shows function tools alongside provider server tools such as OpenAI `tool_search`.
      * Delete a bulk export destination that no bulk export uses with `DELETE /api/v1/bulk-exports/destinations/{destination_id}`. Destinations still referenced by a bulk export are rejected.
      * Custom model price entries now have a **Clone** action, like built-in entries.
      * Run latency values over two minutes display in minutes.
      * The LangSmith Chat model picker now offers Claude Opus 5.5 and Gemini 3.8 Flash, and Gemini models complete turns instead of failing on the first message.
      * Drop or attach images in LangSmith Chat, anywhere in the panel.
      * LangSmith Chat lists runs with previews of their inputs and outputs and opens a run in full only when needed, so large projects no longer make chats and custom app builds fail with "An internal error occurred".
      * LangSmith Chat renews its access during a long turn, so reads of your queues, datasets, and runs keep working instead of ending the turn with an "Invalid token" error.
      * LangSmith Chat groups three or more consecutive exploration actions while building custom apps. Groups open automatically when an action fails or needs attention.
      * Chat keeps working past the first tool call when a workspace model configuration points at Gemini on Vertex AI.

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * Completed annotation queue items can now be deleted from the queue's single-item and bulk views, and through the delete APIs.
      * Custom output renderers in the experiment comparison and single-experiment panes now receive the example's inputs in `metadata.inputs`. Reference outputs are sent with `type: "reference"`, matching the documented message format. [Learn more](/langsmith/custom-output-rendering).
      * Trajectory evaluators are available on every data plane that reports the trajectory runtime as supported, without a per-workspace rollout flag.
      * The trajectory API returns each message's tool definitions only when the request sets `include.tool_definitions` to `true`. The rule editor's **Test** preview now matches what live trajectory evaluations send to the judge.
      * **Include annotator name and comment per row** on the experiment CSV export now takes effect for every workspace.
      * Online LLM-as-a-judge evaluators that return a placeholder JSON field such as `output` now store feedback under the evaluator's configured name.
      * Updating an online evaluator rule through the API no longer fails when the request includes a hub prompt reference but leaves out `evaluator_version`.
      * Thread evaluators no longer offer the **Align Evaluator** flow or correction datasets, since alignment requires run-level examples.
      * Pairwise annotation queues now show `true` and `false` output values when a field is expanded.

      ### Feedback

      * Annotation queue rubric items now appear in the order they were added instead of alphabetically, in the queue editor, the review sidebar, and CSV exports.
      * Feedback extra metadata, including nested metadata, now round-trips through direct and multipart ingestion.
      * The legacy `error` field on feedback creation is deprecated. Send evaluator failures through `extra.error`. The legacy field remains supported and takes precedence when both are provided.

      ### Automations

      * Evaluator traces now use the evaluator's display name instead of the generic `RunnableSequence` name.
      * When an automation cannot fetch runs after its retries are used up, the rule log shows the error that occurred, such as a timeout.

      ### Engine

      * Paste, drop, or attach up to four images in the Engine chat composer and send them with your message.
      * Engine settings open in the board's detail area instead of a slide-over pane, so a settings link can be shared and reopened.
      * Engine highlights support for finding and fixing issues across multiple GitHub repositories, with a shortcut to manage connected repositories in settings.
      * References to other Engine issues in descriptions and proposed fixes link directly to the matching issue. Hover over a link to see the issue title.
      * Connecting a GitHub repository no longer starts a fix run for every open code-rooted issue at once. A fix run starts when you ask for one, or on the board's schedule.
      * Unlinking a pull request from an issue now holds. Engine reads the issue marker only when the pull request is opened, so put the marker in the body when you open it.
      * Engine boards can use write-only custom authentication headers when replaying traces against deployments with custom authentication.
      * Engine fix branches now start with `langsmith-engine/` instead of `issues-agent/`. Issues with a fix branch reserved before this change keep their `issues-agent/` branch.
      * Retrying or editing a message after a turn was cut short no longer fails with "Attempting to delete a message with an ID that doesn't exist".

      ### Prompts and playground

      * Claude Opus 5.5 is available in the Playground for Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, and Vertex AI, and is the default model for new sessions with those providers.
      * The OpenAI model dropdowns now suggest `gpt-6-sol` and `gpt-6-luna`.
      * The Playground renders editable prompts from traces containing LangChain message objects, including multimodal content and messages without an explicit role.
      * Prompt webhook custom headers now persist when saved.
      * The Playground no longer crashes when streaming longer responses.

      ## Deployment

      * The **Overview** tab summarizes the deployed revision on a single line, with its source, age, and logs, and reports a newer rollout there as it queues, builds, or fails. A deploy that failed after replacing the running workload offers a rollback from that line.
      * Production deployment pages show whether the deployment is responding to requests right now, separately from revision status. The badge also appears for deployments served from a custom URL.
      * GitHub revisions show the commit title alongside a badge with the branch and short SHA. The Deployments API returns `repo_commit_title` next to `repo_commit_sha` on each revision.
      * Deployments pinned to an annotated Git tag now record the commit the tag points to in `repo_commit_sha`.
      * Server logs include API and worker logs for AWS deployments whose pod names are shortened by Kubernetes.
      * Studio waits for deployment details to load instead of briefly showing a connection error, and shows the cause when a deployment cannot be loaded.

      ## Sandboxes

      * `access_delegation` on sandbox create now works with a workspace service key, so a deployment that holds only a service key can give its sandboxes capped LangSmith access. Narrowing the key's role narrows the sandbox, and deleting the key revokes it.
      * Each file shared through a sandbox download link is served from its own host, and `csp_sandbox_flags` accepts `allow-same-origin`, so an HTML page can use `localStorage` and IndexedDB without other files reading them.
      * Sandbox calls return 503 with a `Retry-After` header while no host is available, instead of a 502, so clients that retry on 503 recover during host maintenance.
      * Creating a snapshot from an image with no `linux/amd64` variant, such as an arm64-only image built on Apple Silicon, now fails immediately with a message naming the image's platforms.
      * The snapshots table shows tags as badges and a short snapshot ID below each name. Snapshot selectors offer the latest version of each system snapshot.
      * Browser editing for Custom Apps is available to eligible workspaces with sandbox support enabled, and Custom Apps no longer displays a `Beta` badge.

      ## Administration

      * Cloning a dashboard now requires both the `charts:read` and `charts:create` permissions. Roles that can only view charts, such as Workspace Viewer, can no longer clone dashboards, and custom roles that should keep cloning need `charts:create`.
      * Changing the role on a workspace-scoped service key now requires permission to manage keys in every workspace the key covers.
      * Preview the base permissions of each selected role in the service key creation form.
      * Agent Auth connections support encrypted, write-only `token_request_headers` for OAuth token exchange, refresh, and revocation.
      * Resolving Agent Auth principals accepts the `deployments:create` permission in addition to `workspaces:manage`, so Workspace Editors can run `mda dev` with user-owned connections.

      ### LLM Gateway

      * Choose hosted models, providers, or saved configurations from a searchable model picker, run a sample request, and copy its code. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
      * Keep sample code visible while a Gateway request runs, then inspect the response, serving model, HTTP status, token usage, and trace. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
      * The LLM Gateway no longer blocks Claude Max and other provider-billed subscription requests when a Gateway spend policy is exhausted. Rate limits, model access policies, and guardrails still apply.
      * The LLM Gateway preserves Claude feature headers and classifier fields through Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, and Vertex AI Messages routes, including streaming. This enables Claude Code's no-charge server-side auto mode checks where the model and platform support them.
      * Vertex AI model configurations route Anthropic Claude models to Vertex AI's native Anthropic Messages API, while Gemini and open models keep using the OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
      * The LLM Gateway omits temperature from unified API requests unless the destination OpenAI model and reasoning setting support it, preventing unsupported-temperature errors on newer models.
      * The `phase` marker Claude Code sends on partial-turn content blocks no longer causes a 400 error when a `/v1/messages` request targets a Chat Completions model. The marker is dropped with a warning.
      * The spend chart y-axis shows cents when total spend is below a dollar, instead of rounding every label to \$0.
    </Update>

    <Update label="September 14-21, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * The completed items list in an annotation queue now offers Add to Dataset for selected thread items, importing each thread as a multi-turn example.
      * Edit and delete in the experiments table now check project permission, to match BE.
      * Charts now show shape-aware loading skeletons instead of temporary zero values while data loads. Evaluator spend charts use bar and metric placeholders that preserve the final layout.
      * Downloading experiment results with "Include annotator name and comment per row" now keeps automated evaluator scores in every feedback column, alongside human annotations.
      * The evaluators list API accepts an agent\_id filter to return evaluators attached to the agent's environments or tagged datasets.
      * An evaluator using an organization-scoped model configuration that authenticates with an API key no longer attempts a per-model OAuth token exchange. Amazon Bedrock models configured this way are no longer rejected as unsupported.
      * Categorical evaluator fields resize with the editor pane, keeping descriptions and remove-category buttons inside the feedback configuration card.
      * Evaluator side panels disable Save while the configuration is invalid and display the reasons. Correcting the configuration enables saving again.
      * Evaluator forms explain validation errors in the Save tooltip instead of a banner. Save remains disabled until the configuration is valid.
      * Evaluator side panels show mapping errors and prevent saving when run evaluators use thread or trajectory sources, or thread and trajectory evaluators use run sources. Validation updates when the evaluator target changes.
      * Evaluator variable mapping now explains clearly that trajectory and non-trajectory variables cannot be used together.
      * Trajectory evaluation selects the latest trace by its root run's start time rather than a child LLM run's start time. Trajectory metadata reports each trace's actual root start time and marks scopes with missing root timestamps as incomplete.
      * The evaluator configuration form now displays the complete sampling-rate percentage at every supported input size.

      ### Feedback

      * The header count and the delete confirmation on the annotation queue "View all items" page now reflect the active time range instead of the whole queue. The item count endpoint accepts min\_start\_time and max\_start\_time.
      * Changing a feedback score on a completed queue item previously raised a "Failed to update review time" error even though the score saved. The toast is gone; the score still saves as before.
      * The annotation queue size endpoint now counts queue entries whose runs were deleted, matching the queue's run list instead of silently dropping them.

      ### Tracing

      * Publicly shared thread pages no longer show a share action that cannot succeed.
      * Insights no longer warns that it is optimized only for OpenAI or Anthropic when both selected models use another provider.
      * Insights report jobs now retry with a smaller page size when a trace scan times out, instead of failing the whole report.
      * Alerts using input, output, or error text filters match runs regardless of the blob storage and ClickHouse search settings. Search tokens are still written to ClickHouse only when both blob storage and ClickHouse search are enabled.
      * Starting a new conversation immediately after a reply, then sending a message, no longer loses that message. LangSmith Chat now streams it into the new conversation instead of dispatching it against the previous one.
      * When a tracing batch takes longer to upload than the server will wait, /runs/multipart and /runs/batch now stop reading and return 408 Request Timeout instead of a 503. A timeout caused by the server rather than the upload returns 504.
      * Insights now recommends a capable thinking model and a fast summarization model with a large context window, without warning against mixing providers.
      * The LangSmith Go and Java SDKs can now save Insights report configurations, enabling clients to create UI-visible Insights reports programmatically.
      * The Columns menu on a tracing project's traces and runs table now lets you deselect Status and Name, and drag them into any order alongside the other columns.
      * Dashboard chart feedback key suggestions now include keys from both run-level and thread-level feedback.
      * The project stats sidebar shows Cache Hit % above streaming rate, helping you see the share of input tokens served from the prompt cache.
      * Select TURN\_NUMBER when listing thread traces to return each trace's chronological position across pages. Turn numbers are also available for public shared threads.
      * The LangSmith Go and Java SDKs can now list, update, and delete saved Insights report configurations, including their recurring schedules.
      * LangChain trajectories use message IDs from root runs to identify the main conversation, falling back to the existing selection when no unique match is available or optional root enrichment fails. Other formats do not fetch this enrichment. Processing runs and optional roots share one byte budget, and the default message-view and trajectory contribution limits are 200 MB.
      * The thread traces API now accepts `trace_filter` and `tree_filter` query parameters for filtering root runs and matching runs anywhere in a trace tree.
      * The disclosure header of the linked-issues section in the trace detail pane now renders at its intended height instead of clipping its content.

      ### Engine

      * Engine issue descriptions preserve their concise prose while rendering mentioned file paths, functions, classes, tools, and code identifiers as inline code.
      * The issue detail header read its timestamp from the issue's last-modified time, so routine updates, such as Engine linking new evidence and refreshing the description, made a closed issue appear to have just been marked done. The header now reads "Updated `<when>`"; who closed the issue and when is shown in the history below it.
      * Engine now scans projects whose names contain punctuation, Unicode, or other special characters instead of leaving their boards stuck while analysis starts.
      * An Engine scan no longer fails outright when its project-stats request does not come back. It proceeds with the errored and baseline traces it can still select, tells the agent which selections are missing, and records why the stats call failed.
      * The LangSmith Chat composer now accepts focus when a side pane such as Edit Engine Settings is open, so you can ask questions without closing your settings first.
      * LangSmith Chat keeps your conversation as you navigate and reload within a browser tab, and starts a new one in a new tab or after you restart the browser. Earlier conversations are still available from the conversation history.
      * Opening a past LangSmith Chat conversation no longer fails with "Unable to connect to LangGraph server" when the workspace's model credential can no longer be resolved. Reading a conversation only needs its stored history; sending a new message still reports the underlying credential error.
      * Run local production-parity red-team checks against supported Dev targets with their configured trace project and repository context.
      * The LangSmith Chat icon and suggested question now share one continuous background, so the launcher reads as a single pill in light and dark mode.
      * Engine now reads the contents of successful tool results rather than only their status, so it files issues where a call returned less data than its own result claims or where a value arrived truncated. Defects that never surface as an error are no longer passed over.
      * The Home page no longer shows the Engine announcement banner. Engine remains accessible through its Home card and issues section.
      * Engine issue boards now show a spinning “Generating fix” action instead of “Open PR” while a fix is still being generated.
      * An Engine Red Team run on a project that Engine has already scanned now starts from that project's Agent Overview and runs a shorter confirmation scan, instead of re-deriving the application map every time.

      ### Automations

      * Automations grouped by thread can now send webhook payloads with matched conversations and their runs.
      * A backfill that finds every run on a page already processed now continues to the next page instead of ending the window early, so the runs behind that page are still evaluated.
      * A thread or trajectory automation batch that fails its last retry no longer leaves a partial page cursor behind, so the next scheduled window starts from the beginning of the window instead of mid-page. An automation whose trajectory service URL is not configured now records one failed rule-log entry instead of retrying until the attempt limit.
      * A trajectory evaluator's retention upgrade no longer bounds the trace by an approximate start time, so the root run and its earliest children are upgraded along with the rest. The evaluated-run link on a trajectory evaluator's trace is withheld until it can point at the right run.

      ### Monitoring and alerting

      * Choosing a Slack channel for alert notifications now works in workspaces large enough that the channel list had stopped loading altogether.
      * Charts now show loading placeholders that match their final visualization, including bar, line, donut, metric, and sparkline charts.

      ## Deployment

      * Scale-to-zero deployments reject rollbacks to revisions below LangGraph API 0.13.0 or without a known compatible version. The rollback dialog directs you to rebuild the target commit with a supported version.
      * Your plan's included free Serverless deployment is now assigned automatically no matter how you create it. Previously only deployments created through the web app took the free slot, so a first deployment created via the CLI or API was billed even when a free one was available.
      * Newly created Slack apps in mention mode respond to explicit mentions in group DMs and their threads, preventing duplicate runs from overlapping events. One-to-one DMs and all-messages mode continue to receive ordinary messages.
      * Section dividers in agent overview cards and Gateway connection panels have stronger contrast in light and dark mode.
      * The Studio memory editor keeps its close button visible while you scroll through long memory items.
      * Filter the custom apps list by creator and preserve the selection in the page URL.
      * Creating a dev deployment now shows how many free deployments your organization has left and uses an available free slot automatically. The separate free deployment option has been removed.
      * Self-hosted upgrades can rerun the usage metering migration without duplicate-trigger errors or replacing existing model pricing with default rates.
      * Managed Deep Agents can discover OAuth settings from an MCP server's authentication challenge when well-known metadata lookup fails.

      ## Sandboxes

      * View compute and storage cost estimates for individual sandboxes and snapshots in Granular usage. Filter by workspace, date, and resource type, and export the breakdown as CSV.
      * New custom apps open the preview panel when Polly starts writing files. The unfinished first draft stays covered until generation completes and the preview is ready.
      * Custom app previews show an animated loading illustration while starting, with a static version for reduced motion. Published previews fade in when ready.
      * Pasting an ECR repository or image URL keeps AWS IAM role authentication available. Registry forms explain that the registry hostname is saved and repositories are selected when creating a snapshot.
      * Create sandboxes from a shared, read-only catalog of system snapshots: system/default:latest, system/custom-apps:latest with Smith Apps tooling, and system/code-evaluators:latest with NumPy preinstalled. Choose system or workspace snapshots from the same sandbox and Fleet selectors.
      * The system/code-evaluators:latest snapshot includes pandas, jsonschema, SciPy, and scikit-learn alongside NumPy, so evaluators can use ACE's supported Python packages without installing them.
      * A sandbox calling the API under an access-delegation grant can still create sandboxes, but can no longer give one a grant of its own. Audit entries for a delegated call now name the sandbox that made it.
      * A sandbox's service URLs can now be listed, showing which ports are shared and how, and sharing can be turned off for one port or all of them. Previously a service URL could be created but never inspected or withdrawn.
      * An app served behind a LangSmith-login service URL now receives the signed-in user's id and email as X-Langsmith-User-Id and X-Langsmith-User-Email. The signed X-Langsmith-User-Token carrying the same identity is unchanged, and remains the right choice for an app that needs to verify it.

      ## Administration

      * You can revoke and reinstate personal access tokens directly from the API Keys table in Settings. Reinstatement preserves the token's expiry date, and expired tokens show a disabled Reinstate key action with an explanation.
      * Revoking a personal access token preserves its original expiry. Reinstating the token restores access only while that expiry remains valid.
      * Adds a reusable ThinkingState component for AI activity, with three animation variants, an opt-in elapsed timer, and reduced-motion support.
      * Agent Auth automatically registers MCP OAuth clients that require client-secret authentication, storing their credentials securely alongside existing public-client support.
      * Managed Parallel tools require a paid workspace plan. Tool calls returning HTTP 200 record usage at 1,000 calls per LangSmith Unit.
      * Agent-auth principal creation accepts provider and subject without an issuer. Omitted or null issuers use an empty namespace, while supplied issuers retain their existing validation.
      * Browser Back retains navigation guards when returning to the initially loaded page, including cleanup of empty, undeployed custom apps.
      * Open Notifications in the sidebar to view platform announcements and account notices without interrupting your work. Incident alerts remain at the top of the page.

      ### LLM Gateway

      * Group LLM Gateway usage by Model Provider within an API key or user to compare spend across providers and filter to specific providers.
      * The Gateway provider search field now uses a more comfortable height while remaining aligned with standard component sizes.
      * Gateway requests now log traces only to the shared gateway project instead of also creating duplicates in API-key or user-specific projects. Existing caller-specific projects and their historical traces remain unchanged.
      * The LLM Gateway now supports direct passthrough requests to TypeSafe's System One API using workspace credentials.
      * LangSmith applies configured LLM Gateway guard policies to TypeSafe System One prompt state before forwarding requests.
      * LLM Gateway traces for TypeSafe Jev calls now include token usage and calculate costs at TypeSafe's published rate.
      * LangSmith now supports TypeSafe in model access policies and provides System One examples for direct Gateway requests.
      * Gateway data protection now scans string values throughout nested TypeSafe System One state objects and arrays, including fields such as name, id, and instructions. Redaction preserves the native payload structure for both Gateway Credits and bring-your-own-key requests.
    </Update>

    <Update label="September 7-14, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Feedback

      * Feedback in annotation queues are now attributed by whichever identity the request resolves, so a reviewer's own answers count toward required fields.
      * When a score sent through the SDK violates the workspace feedback key configuration, multipart ingest now accepts the request and records error feedback on the run with the rejection reason in the comment, instead of returning a 400 that dropped the run and every other feedback sent with it.
      * The annotations pane notes now work when the session\_id is invalid, but a valid trace\_session\_id is provided.

      ### Engine

      * Engine issue validation now reconstructs prior thread turns before replaying a trace, so follow-up failures are judged in the same conversation context.
      * Engine issue validation now retries when preparing replay traces hits a Runs API rate limit, instead of treating that as a permanent failure and leaving the result inconclusive.

      ### Tracing

      * Starting September 14, 2026, traces ingested into LangSmith SaaS with extended retention are kept for at most 180 days. Existing extended retention settings above 180 days are applied as 180 days for new traces, and new settings above 180 days are rejected. Self-hosted and BYOC deployments are unchanged. [Learn more](/langsmith/usage-and-billing#data-retention).
      * Chat on a tracing project now reads the filters, view, time window and selection you have on screen, names runs and threads by what was asked rather than by the app that served them, and says what it is working through while it reasons.
      * Interacting with LangSmith Chat in the sidebar, including conversation history and model selection, keeps the peeked run or thread pane open. Clicking outside the pane and chat still dismisses the pane.
      * Model configurations that set a Vertex AI multi-region location such as `us` or `eu` now reach the correct Google endpoint instead of failing with a 400. Configurations using a single region or `global` are unaffected.
      * LangSmith MCP now includes a `list_model_price_maps` tool for searching and paginating model pricing rules in a workspace.
      * Trace tree connector lines now join smoothly between rows.

      ### Prompts and playground

      * Switching between files in Context Hub now keeps the selected Preview or Source view.
      * Organizations with the LLM auth proxy enabled can select Google Vertex AI models in the playground and Agent Builder without storing a Vertex service account key in the workspace.
      * Context Hub repositories now support up to 1,500 files, allowing agents with larger skill collections to sync successfully.
      * OpenAI model configuration dropdowns now suggest gpt-6-astra.

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * Trajectory online evaluators now route to the correct applier and receive trajectory input. Malformed configurations surface as visible errors instead of silently producing empty evaluations. When trace retention is enabled, trajectory rules extend retention for the latest trace in each resolved trajectory.

      ## Deployment

      * Find custom apps by name or creator from the custom apps list.
      * Updating install or build commands through the deployment API now creates a new revision. Docker sources reject these commands because they deploy prebuilt images.
      * After a Managed Deep Agent run paused for credentials resumes, the Slack connect card is removed instead of being replaced with a confirmation, so the agent's reply is the next thing in the thread.
      * Managed Deep Agent runs paused on a Slack credential prompt now resume once the last connection completes, instead of stalling after all integrations are connected.

      ## Sandboxes

      * LangSmith Cloud can now assume tagged customer IAM roles for ECR repository discovery and snapshot image pulls.
      * Sandboxes now use the guest kernel's maximum open-file limit, allowing highly concurrent agents and subprocesses to run without exhausting the default descriptor ceiling.
      * Sandboxes now pass raw TCP connections to literal public IP addresses when the destination IP and port are explicitly allow-listed. This supports clients that resolve a service and dial its public IP directly. [Learn more](/langsmith/sandbox-auth-proxy).

      ## Administration

      * Authenticated service startup checks now use endpoint authentication when the deployment info endpoint is protected.
      * LangSmith Cloud now warns organization admins in the days before an enterprise contract or a cancelled plan expires, so they can renew before losing access.
      * Workspace administrators can view workspace-level Agent Auth connections from the Integrations settings page, including authentication type and update details.
      * Workspace administrators can select an Agent Auth connection to inspect its associated credential metadata without exposing secret or token material.
      * Built-in workspace roles stop returning the retired repos:\* and run-rules:\* permissions, which were renamed to prompts:\* and rules:\* and are rejected when creating a custom role. Copying a built-in role's permission list into a new custom role now works. [Learn more](/langsmith/organization-workspace-operations).
      * The organization SSO login URL now accepts a `redirect_to` path, so a link like `/sso/login/<slug>?redirect_to=/o/<org>/projects/p/<project>/r/<run>` lands on that page after SAML sign-in instead of the workspace root.
      * Organization Operators can no longer grant the Organization Admin role to a service key, or change the roles of a service key that already holds it. A service key also can no longer change its own roles; another credential must make the change.

      ### LLM Gateway

      * GET /v1/models now returns only the models your model access policies allow, so the gateway no longer advertises models that would be rejected when called.
      * New model access policies now include a generated policy name that you can keep or edit before creation.
      * The LLM Gateway uses each saved model configuration's provider and API preference when selecting a fallback, so Bedrock Claude models use the Messages API instead of an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
      * Data policy dialogs now show a Personally Identifiable Information (PII) option under Data protection for every organization. Organizations without the PII entitlement see it locked, with a link to request access.
      * The LLM Gateway returns resolved model names and cost-tracking provider identities in the `x-langsmith-gateway-metadata` response header for unified requests, including configured models and fallbacks. Client-side tracing can use these values as `ls_model_name` and `ls_provider` for accurate pricing, while preserving normalized pricing model names across fallbacks.
      * Model Access policies can now allow a workspace's saved model configurations, either all of them or a chosen few, by enabling the new "Model configurations" provider. Requests that reach a configuration, including fallback candidates that resolve to one, are permitted for the calling credential's workspace, where previously any Model Access policy blocked them.
    </Update>

    <Update label="August 31-September 7, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Automations

      * Configuring an evaluator with a trace or tree filter no longer times out while loading the sample run shown in the preview.

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * The add-to-dataset popup for threads now offers New Dataset, which creates the dataset empty and adds the selected threads to it.
      * Requesting dataset runs with a limit above 100 now returns a 422 naming the cap instead of a generic internal error.
      * Mapping an evaluator prompt variable to a single message, such as `output.messages[0]`, now renders that message instead of an empty value.
      * Validating examples with unsupported completion outputs now reports a schema validation error instead of failing with an internal error.
      * Passing a malformed share token to the shared-dataset projects endpoint now returns a validation error naming the bad value instead of an internal error.
      * Trajectory batch reads now run on a dedicated in-cluster gRPC service instead of the `smith-go` monolith, so load and memory pressure from trajectory evaluations no longer competes with UI and API traffic.
      * Dataset CSV and JSONL exports now require both dataset read and download permissions. Direct API requests without download permission return a forbidden response.
      * IssueBench now includes a benchmark task that compares pre- and post-Opus 5 agent traces for cost and trajectory regressions.
      * Dataset experiments launched from edited Hub prompts save portable Gateway model configurations while preserving the variable mappings used for execution. Saved drafts exclude runtime credentials and remain compatible with standard LangChain SDKs.
      * Editing surfaces such as evaluator forms, playground prompts, and dataset examples no longer error out when the editor unmounts while its content is still refreshing.

      ### Engine

      * When Engine marks an issue as a duplicate, the issue header now shows a Duplicate link to the original instead of a history note that included the other issue's id.

      ### Prompts and playground

      * Requesting, updating, or deleting a playground model configuration with a malformed ID now returns a validation error naming the bad value instead of an internal error.
      * Sending a null artifact to the prompt canvas now returns a 422 naming the missing field instead of a generic internal error.
      * Context Hub now opens markdown files in Source mode on the exact bytes stored in the repo, and saving a change no longer rewrites files you did not edit. Previously, the rich-text editor reserialized every markdown file in the directory on load, which could strip XML-style delimiters and add backslash escapes to untouched content.
      * Claude Fable 5.1 is now available in the Anthropic, Bedrock, and Vertex AI model selectors in the playground.
      * Prompts saved with a LangSmith Gateway model now use a standard ChatOpenAI manifest with the unified Gateway URL and a `LANGSMITH_GATEWAY_API_KEY` secret reference, so they can be pulled and run with standard LangChain SDKs.
      * Amazon Bedrock models in the Playground now expose the same request timeout and max retries options as other providers, so long-running agent calls are no longer cut off at the AWS client default of 60 seconds.
      * Gateway presets retain their model settings and stay selected when reopened without changes. You can explicitly clear a model selection, and new Gateway configurations no longer preselect a model or impose a default output-token limit.
      * The Playground now runs saved LangSmith Gateway models, including models with bound settings, through the configured Gateway using the authenticated request context. Ordinary OpenAI and custom-endpoint models keep their existing routing.

      ### Tracing

      * The thread header now has Add to dataset and Add to annotation queue buttons in every thread view, including Messages, Turns, and Details, so a whole thread can be added without selecting a run.
      * Use the new `/v2/threads/stats` endpoint to retrieve thread and trace counts, latency, token, cost, and feedback statistics for a tracing project.
      * Thread query clients can request server-sent events to receive results progressively while preserving cursor pagination.
      * Use `/v2/threads/stats` on self-hosted deployments backed by ClickHouse, including when SmithDB queries are disabled. Scoped trace and thread filters still require SmithDB and are ignored otherwise; tree filters are best-effort.

      ## Deployment

      * When a Slack channel event fails before reaching your Managed Deep Agent, for example a dropped delivery, a missing bot token, an interrupt that cannot be shown, or an ambiguous route, it now surfaces in `mda logs` and the deployment logs UI instead of failing silently.
      * LangSmith MCP connectors use Client ID Metadata Documents when supported, with dynamic client registration retained as a compatibility fallback.
      * Agent OAuth connections now show a provider-branded result page after authorization, making successful and failed connection attempts clearer.
      * Managed Deep Agent channel replies now name a missing workspace connection and show how an agent developer can configure it, instead of reporting only a generic run failure.

      ## Sandboxes

      * Commercial private ECR registries can now assume an AWS IAM role on demand, enabling repository and tag search while avoiding expiring saved authorization tokens.

      ## Administration

      * Self-hosted LangSmith operators can configure how many days before license expiration the warning banner appears with `LICENSE_EXPIRATION_WARNING_DAYS`. The default remains seven days.
      * OAuth authorization sessions now accept `owner_type` and `owner_id`, so a human can authorize a managed credential for either a user or an agent.
      * Workspace editors can now assign resources to an Application tag value from Settings > Resource Tags instead of hitting a permission error. [Learn more](/langsmith/set-up-resource-tags)
      * The workspace switcher now accepts workspace IDs in addition to workspace names, making it easier to locate a workspace when only its ID is known.
      * OAuth authorization sessions now accept workspace owners, allowing one managed OAuth credential to be shared across a workspace.

      ### LLM Gateway

      * Set `ls_provider` on OpenAI-compatible model configurations to populate trace metadata and match custom models to provider-specific pricing through the LLM Gateway. [Learn more](/langsmith/ls-metadata-parameters#ls_provider)
      * LLM Gateway fallback chains can now advance to the next model when a candidate does not return response headers within a configured timeout. Active response streams continue after headers arrive.
      * Gateway requests authenticated with a session or OAuth bearer token retain their authentication and workspace context across internal routing, including model fallbacks. This prevents authentication failures when a request requires another Gateway hop.
    </Update>

      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Tracing

      * ABAC policies can grant access to matching project traces.
      * Open deployment threads directly in tracing.
      * Clearer Engine issue actions now appear on traces.
      * You can read shared threads through the public API.
      * Trace and tree filters now apply to thread evaluations.
      * Unsupported run filters now return clearer errors.
      * Studio Trace nested run selection now works correctly.
      * The Gateway usage view can open filtered traces.

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * Experiment evaluator column names now use the full column width.
      * You can clone model configurations.
      * Tuned Evaluators are easier to find in tracing projects.
      * Data grids now adapt to enlarged browser fonts.
      * Form errors are announced consistently.
      * The dashboard crosshair stays synchronized across charts.
      * The Engine chat launcher now suggests questions.

      ### Engine

      * Engine now uses application-scoped project counts.
      * Create existing Engine issues in Linear.
      * You can open a pull request for an Engine issue straight from the toolbar.
      * Engine issues stay in sync with Linear.
      * Engine now shows a release announcement in the sidebar.
      * Engine now distinguishes a missing capability from an errored or partially wired tool, reducing false-positive Feature Gap issues.
      * Pull requests for Engine fixes now open automatically.
      * Opening a second linked trace from an Engine issue now works reliably.
      * Open PR also works for fixes that have fallen behind the base branch.
      * Engine usage now costs 40% fewer Usage Credits.

      ### Gateway

      * Newer OpenAI models now route through Amazon Bedrock.
      * Trailing slashes now work on LLM Gateway routes.
      * Recursive LLM Gateway configurations are now prevented.
      * PII redaction is now a separate LLM Gateway entitlement.
      * Claude Max OAuth traffic is now excluded from Gateway spend.
      * Saved model configurations now work on the unified LLM Gateway endpoint.
      * Custom providers now work on the unified LLM Gateway endpoint.
      * Gateway data policies are available by default.
      * You can use saved model configurations in LLM Gateway routing.
      * Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform gateway now supports existing web credentials.
      * OpenAI-compatible API base paths are now respected.
      * Custom provider configurations become available faster.
      * LLM gateway traces no longer capture request and response content by default.
      * Long-lived API keys are now available in the Gateway quickstart.

      ### Platform and deployment

      * Run rules now support Redis cluster-safe mode.
      * Thread annotation queues are now available in self-hosted deployments.
      * Thread automations can add to annotation queues in self-hosted deployments.
      * Sandbox execution timeout errors are clearer.
      * Updating a sandbox's proxy config no longer conflicts with a start.

      * Fleet sandbox APIs now work with external OIDC auth.
      * Fleet computers keep uploaded Excel workbooks locally.
      * Check Outlook calendar availability.

    <Update label="August 17-24, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * Freeform rubric items in an annotation queue now support an optional regex validator. A reviewer's comment that doesn't match the configured pattern is blocked from saving, with an inline error, instead of silently persisting.
      * Organization admins can open Tuned Evaluator settings directly from paused evaluator warnings and disabled-toggle tooltips. Other users see guidance to contact an organization admin.
      * Annotation queues now support a Data Formatting setting that hides selected JSON paths from a run's Inputs and Outputs while reviewing; pick fields via checkboxes generated from a sample run, or type a path manually. Applies to run items only, not threads.
      * Tuned Evaluators are now hidden in BYOC workspaces and self-hosted deployments, where LangChain-managed inference is unavailable.

      ### Tracing

      * Hovering a bar in the trace waterfall view now shows the same run info tooltip as the run tree, including start and end time, time to first token, token and cost breakdown, and tags.
      * Insights now recommends GPT-5.6 Terra and Claude Sonnet 5 for thinking, plus GPT-5.6 Luna for OpenAI summarization.
      * Opening a trace from an Insights category now keeps the trace pane header inside the pane: the header actions, including Run in Studio, switch to their compact form whenever the pane is too narrow for the full-size buttons.
      * LangSmith Chat now reads as a record of what it did. Every tool it runs gets a row naming the action and what it acted on, with the result one click away; a plan appears when it takes one on, and a subagent shows the steps it is working through. Long results fold to a readable height, files and diffs render as files and diffs, and the panel can be resized or docked to the sidebar.
      * Add a guard in the langchain and anthropic trajectory extractors to prevent errors when a run's messages field isn't stored as a list, consistent with the vercel and otel adapters.
      * Insights category names that do not fit in the table column now show their full text on hover.
      * Insights table columns can now be narrowed beyond their header labels, with full header text available on hover when truncated.
      * Thread detail panes now slide into view consistently when opened from a tracing project.
      * Opening a shared link to an issue now loads that specific issue, including issues marked as ignored, instead of displaying the first issue in the list.
      * Runs using the bare "gpt-5.6" model id now calculate cost correctly. The pricing rule previously only matched the "gpt-5.6-sol" id variant.
      * Controlled inputs no longer create redundant local state updates, preventing rare page crashes while typing in tracing filters.

      ### Engine

      * The recurrence chart on an issue now labels its x-axis with a day-and-month axis instead of repeating the month on every tick, runs its window up to the present, and states when the issue was last seen. An issue that stopped recurring months ago no longer looks like one that recurred this morning.
      * Copy Fix now pastes diagnosis, linked traces, and LangSmith CLI commands, plus a silent PR marker. When a PR in the connected repo includes that marker, Engine attaches it and shows open, closed, or merged status.
      * Each row in the Engine issue list now shows the timestamp the list is sorted by, labeled and right-aligned; "Created 5d ago", "Updated 3h ago", "Seen 11m ago"; in place of the trace count. Hovering any issue date, on the row or in the issue header, shows the created, updated, and last-seen times together.
      * The Engine overview no longer shows a duplicate configuration button. Engine settings remain available from the issue board toolbar.
      * Sorting the Engine issue board now orders purely by the chosen field (Severity, Last Seen, Last Updated, Created, or number of traces), including resolved and dismissed issues. Status and other filters hide mismatches immediately, and each board remembers its sort and filters in the browser.
      * The Fix panel can detach a linked GitHub pull request from an issue without closing it, so a different PR can be attached afterward.
      * The issues API accepts a `trace_id` query parameter that returns only the issues with a run linked from that trace.
      * Searching the project switcher on the Engine page now matches project names the same way the tracing project list does, instead of returning loosely-related projects.
      * A pull request opened from an Engine issue now takes its title and description from the fix run's own commit message, so it explains the change a reviewer is looking at instead of restating the issue report. Every fix PR also links back to the issue it came from.
      * The sidebar no longer displays the Try Engine promotional popover over the Tracing link.
      * Listing Slack channels for a workspace with tens of thousands of conversations needs more than one of Slack's rate-limit windows. The background refresh now has a budget that spans them, so the picker fills instead of staying empty.
      * The Slack channel picker for watching alerts now opens toward the left, keeping the full channel list visible within the issue panel.
      * The Engine issue list now opens on a Default sort that leads with watched issues that have picked up new traces, then open and fixing work, then quiet watched issues, with closed and ignored ones last. Severity and last-seen order issues within each group.
      * The Engine issue list's Status filter now covers triage state only; Open, Resolved, and Incorrectly Flagged; where Open includes issues with a fix in flight or under watch. A new Activity filter selects those independently, so filtering to Open no longer hides issues Engine is actively working on.
      * The standalone Engine page now links directly to the selected project's tracing view.
      * LangSmith Chat now reads the Issues Board beyond the issue you have open, ranking issues by what to triage first, what fired most recently, or what cites the most traces, and measuring how a board breaks down, recurs, spreads and trends over a period you choose. It also checks an issue against the traces it cites before telling you the failure is real.
      * Listing Slack channels stopped after a fixed number of pages, so a workspace with tens of thousands of archived conversations had its channel list quietly cut short. Paging now runs until Slack reports the end of the list.

      ### Prompts and playground

      * Context Hub repositories containing legacy files beneath linked directories can now be read, materialized, cloned, and edited. Reads use the linked directory contents, and the next successful edit removes conflicting legacy entries without changing linked repositories.

      ### Monitoring and alerting

      * Create and edit alert actions now remain in a sticky footer, so you can submit changes without scrolling to the bottom of the form. [Learn more](/langsmith/alerts).
      * The Streaming rate over time template now divides runs with a first token time by LLM runs only, so a new chart matches the streaming rate shown elsewhere in LangSmith.
      * Adds a reusable BarChart component to the LangSmith design system, standardizing grouped and stacked bars, horizontal and vertical layouts, multiple value axes, threshold bands, interactions, and keyboard accessibility.
      * Webhook test notifications now show the destination's HTTP status and reason phrase, helping you diagnose URL, availability, and authentication failures.

      ### Automations

      * Thread webhook and annotation-queue automations now show thread filters instead of run filters, and no longer default to Is Trace = true.
      * Automation rules scoped to threads now show the project's thread idle time, with a link to change it in project settings.

      ## Deployment

      * Studio chat now shows results for provider built-in tools such as web\_fetch and web\_search, and groups a run of consecutive tool calls into a single collapsible entry instead of one row per call.
      * Self-hosted deployment forms now preserve fractional CPU request and limit values for application and queue containers.
      * GCP Redis IAM cluster discovery now uses TLS when Redis cluster TLS is enabled, allowing self-hosted deployments to combine IAM authentication with TLS-required Memorystore clusters.
      * Studio switches deployment and connection controls to compact icons when the graph pane is narrow, preventing toolbar actions from overlapping.
      * Deployment Overview now surfaces high Postgres disk usage and pending run counts, so operators can spot issues without opening Monitoring.

      ## Sandboxes

      * Sandboxes now mount Context Hub repositories through a read-only, host-served filesystem, so files are directly accessible without polling for asynchronous guest materialization. Repository updates appear atomically, and mounts recover across memory-backed stop and start.
      * Attach a free-form description when creating or capturing a snapshot, and to proxy rules and proxy configs. Descriptions are stored and returned on reads, so you can hand an agent a plain-language summary of what its sandbox image and network access can do.
      * Sandbox file downloads now accept a Range header, so you can fetch part of a large file or resume an interrupted transfer instead of starting over. Responses carry an ETag for safe resumes and the same path answers HEAD, reporting a file's size without transferring it.
      * You can now mint a signed link that downloads a single sandbox file with no LangSmith credential, so files can be handed to a browser or any client that cannot carry an API key. Links are served from the sandbox service domain, never expire unless you set expires\_in\_seconds, and can pin the response content type and disposition. A link's content is cached indefinitely, so mint a new link when the file changes.
      * Sandbox proxy rules and callbacks no longer accept match\_hosts patterns like `*.com` or `*.co.uk`, which would have sent injected credentials to every host under a top-level domain. Wildcards must now name a registrable domain, such as `*.example.com`.
      * GET /v2/sandboxes/boxes now pages with page\_size and an opaque cursor, returning items and next\_cursor. The limit and offset parameters and the sandboxes and offset response fields still work but are deprecated.
      * Updating a sandbox's proxy configuration no longer requires the sandbox to be running. A stopped sandbox stores the new configuration and applies it the next time it starts, instead of rejecting the request.
      * GET /v2/sandboxes/snapshots now pages with page\_size and an opaque cursor, returning items and next\_cursor. The limit and offset parameters and the snapshots and offset response fields still work but are deprecated.

      ## Administration

      * Organization admins can now delete custom roles from the roles settings page. Roles still in use by a user, SCIM group, or SSO settings cannot be deleted until reassigned.
      * Each data plane card in organization settings now has a copy button next to its name, so you can grab the data plane ID without opening dev tools.
      * Custom roles can now grant feedback-configs:create, feedback-configs:update, and feedback-configs:delete independently of feedback submission, so a role can be scoped to submitting feedback without also being able to create, edit, or delete feedback config (rubric) definitions.
      * Billing settings now name the two credit tabs Credit usage (previously Contract usage) and Credit grants (previously Credits). Credit usage tracks burndown against your prepaid gateway credits.
      * The Storybook overview now links every component card to its dedicated page and shows accurate progress examples.
      * The login CAPTCHA now appears beside the active email or SSO field while preserving entered form values when switching methods.
      * Workspace roles can grant API key creation and deletion without granting full workspace administration. Key managers can scope service keys to permitted workspaces and assign unrestricted roles.

      ### LLM Gateway

      * The Gateway Credits balance card now explains that credits access models hosted by LangChain, and the Gateway home quickstart notes that running a request costs a trace but no additional LangChain fee.
      * Running a request against Gateway Credits (hosted models) in the Gateway home quickstart now offers to set a monthly spend limit, matching the Bring Your Own Key flow.
      * The three cards at the top of the Gateway home page; Spend limits, Model fallbacks, and Gateway usage; are now static orientation content instead of clickable shortcuts, so they read as a quick summary of what LLM Gateway does rather than navigation.
      * The LLM Gateway now returns 424 Failed Dependency instead of a generic 400 Bad Request when a required provider API key is absent from workspace secrets. The error response also identifies the missing secret and explains how to resolve it.
      * The LLM Gateway browser quickstart now lets you create a monthly workspace spend limit inline, right where you're recommended one, instead of opening a separate dialog.
      * The API key modal launched from Gateway home now defaults to a personal access token and hides the service key, key type, and default workspace fields that don't apply to a new Gateway user. Expiration is capped at 30 days.
      * Gateway Credits balance, policy spend, and Gateway Monitoring's spend stats, chart, and table now show `&lt;$0.01` for a positive amount under a cent instead of rounding it down to `$0.00`, so a small amount of spend no longer looks like nothing happened.
      * The LLM Gateway now forwards Claude Code Max OAuth credentials for every organization, without requiring a workspace Anthropic API key.
      * LLM Gateway spend controls and data protection policies now open in focused side panes, keeping actions visible in the header and warning before unsaved changes are discarded.
      * Gateway traces now carry a `gateway.credential_source` metadata field naming the credential that paid for each upstream LLM call (`credits`, `byok`, `subscription_oauth`, or `platform_managed`), allowing you to filter and chart Gateway Credits usage separately from bring-your-own-key usage, plus a `gateway.provider` field naming the provider route that served the call.
      * Default gateway spend and rate limits can track and enforce separate buckets for each value of a configured X-Gateway request header.
      * LLM Gateway rate-limit creation and policy editing now use focused side panes with unsaved-change warnings. New policies receive descriptive generated names, and optional custom-header conditions are grouped under an advanced section.
      * Gateway spend limit forms can configure custom-header buckets, and cost policy tables show which header separates each default limit.
      * The LLM Gateway now supports xAI API keys and Grok models through native and unified Responses and Chat Completions endpoints, with tracing and spend attribution. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
      * LLM Gateway fallback policies can now route failed provider-model requests through an ordered chain of native provider models and saved model configurations. Configure which HTTP status codes advance to the next candidate, while successful requests continue directly to the original model.
      * The Model Fallbacks tab now lets you create and manage automatic fallback chains for provider models. Choose ordered backup models or saved model configurations, select which HTTP errors trigger fallback, and copy a ready-to-use Gateway request example.
      * LLM Gateway model fallback policies can now route between providers that use OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, or Anthropic Messages formats. The gateway translates requests, non-streaming responses, and streaming responses for both unified and direct provider endpoints.
    </Update>

    <Update label="August 10-17, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * Annotation queue tables now label queue contents as items instead of runs, covering both single-run and pairwise queues.
      * Datasets whose input, output, or metadata keys contain a colon can now be exported to CSV. This unblocks datasets built from runs with feedback, where feedback is stored under a `source_run_feedback:<key>` metadata key.
      * Managed evaluator configuration no longer shows evaluator tracing controls.
      * The Datasets & Experiments table now labels dataset names with a Dataset column header, making the relationship between datasets and experiments clearer.

      ### Monitoring and alerting

      * In dashboards and other surfaces where "All time" is unavailable, clearing both dates in the date picker now disables Apply instead of silently submitting an all-time range that fails to load.
      * Opening a run from a dashboard chart's runs table now shows a single trace pane instead of stacking a second, identical pane behind the first.

      ### Automations

      * Online evaluators configured with a saved custom provider model configuration (OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible) now use that configuration's endpoint and credentials on live traces instead of failing with a permission error.
      * Non-admin users can now save evaluator edits from the dataset, tracing project, and thread panes without hitting a retention-permission error.
      * Automations grouped by thread can now add one annotation queue item for each matched conversation, so reviewers can inspect the whole thread instead of only one run.
      * Thread webhook and annotation-queue automations now show thread filters instead of run filters, and no longer default to `Is Trace = true`.

      ### Engine

      * The Slack channel list now refreshes in the background even when Slack rate-limits the request, so large workspaces no longer lose picker options.
      * Engine fix runs no longer push a branch for every code fix. The commit is parked on a hidden ref and the branch is created when you open a pull request, so connected repositories keep a clean branch list.
      * Engine now highlights only Slack notifications in its announcement area and continues to honor prior dismissals.
      * Unread Engine issues now show a lighter brand pip aligned to the right of the title, so new issues are easier to scan without competing with the title.

      ### Tracing

      * The Turns view in thread detail is deprecated in favor of the Messages or Details view, and LangSmith Cloud removes it on October 31, 2026, while self-hosted removes it in v17.
      * Thread annotation-queue and webhook automations now require SmithDB queries.
      * LangSmith Chat now offers GPT-5.6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Terra, and GPT-5.6 Luna alongside the existing OpenAI models.
      * LangSmith now recognizes older trace links containing timestamp-prefixed run and trace IDs.
      * The tracing quickstart now opens with Deep Agents selected and leads with Deep Agents, LangGraph, and LangChain framework guides.
      * Trace details now surface LLM Gateway outcomes, policy limits, selected models, and fallback attempts in a dedicated Gateway section. Errored LLM runs blocked by the gateway also show a Blocked badge in the trace tree.

      ## Deployment

      * LangSmith services now accept both IPv4 and IPv6 connections.
      * Deployments now resolve the latest agent server version more reliably, preventing slow revision creation and duplicate revisions caused by request timeouts, especially in Asia Pacific.
      * LangSmith workers using Microsoft Entra ID authentication for standalone Redis now start successfully and continue refreshing credentials after the event loop starts.

      ## Sandboxes

      * Mounting a git repository into a sandbox no longer fails silently. Clones now trust the sandbox's certificate bundle, so the repository appears at its mount path instead of starting in an empty directory.
      * Sandboxes now retain recent CPU, memory, and network usage history, making it easier to understand resource consumption and diagnose performance bottlenecks.
      * WebSocket connections through a sandbox service URL now reach your service with their query string intact. Dev servers that authenticate their own WebSocket with a query parameter, such as Vite's HMR token, now connect instead of failing.

      ## Administration

      * The signup page animation stays aligned with the hero content after the confirmation message appears.
      * Users with the tag-on-create permission for datasets, projects, or prompts can now see and apply tags when creating those resources, instead of only workspace managers.
      * The API Keys page now filters keys across the full paginated list by key, description, and workspace.
      * The organization usage dashboard renders its charts again; they previously could appear blank even when usage data was present, showing only the workspace legend.

      ### LLM Gateway

      * Requests to Bedrock models through the unified LLM Gateway now use the API format supported by each model family. Anthropic models use Messages, OpenAI models use Responses, and other Bedrock models use Chat Completions, preventing unsupported API errors for models such as Claude Opus.
      * The LLM Gateway can now reach Amazon Bedrock with an assumed IAM role or AWS access keys instead of a static Bedrock API key, and existing Bedrock API keys still take precedence when multiple credential types are configured.
      * The LLM Gateway quickstart now hides the Run request action for workspace members without gateway invocation permission.
      * LLM Gateway responses now include an `X-LangSmith-Gateway-Metadata` header describing gateway routing, limits, guard activity, and upstream errors, and clients can attach it to their own traces as `ls_gateway_info` metadata.
    </Update>

    <Update label="August 3-10, 2026">
      ## Access control

      * Access-policy endpoints now report errors as RFC 7807 problem details. Error messages move from the `error` field to `detail`, and semantically invalid request bodies return HTTP 422.
      * Set a resource tag key or value description to `null` to clear it through the PATCH API.
      * New connections to the hosted LangSmith MCP server failed to register when the client requested a confidential authentication method. Dynamic client registration now issues a public client in that case instead of returning an error, so connecting from Claude and other MCP clients works again.
      * Role permission and access policy changes now invalidate cached authorization results reliably, including when an older transaction commits after a newer update.
      * LangSmith now refreshes cached role access policies as soon as their permissions change, preventing stale authorization decisions in split-plane deployments.
      * The Active, Pending, and Deactivated tabs on the Members settings page now switch on the first click while keeping pagination and sorting in sync.

      ## Datasets and experiments

      * Attachment and object downloads now always declare how the browser should handle the response. Files whose type is unrecognized, or that were stored without a type, are delivered as downloads instead of being rendered in the page.
      * Creating a dataset from the Datasets or Home empty state now opens the new dataset instead of briefly showing a Page not found screen.
      * Dataset JSON schema descriptions are now safely rendered in editor tooltips.
      * Creating or validating an example with a `dataset_id` that is not a well-formed UUID now returns a 422 naming the field instead of a 500.
      * Listing or counting examples with an unsupported `filter` expression, an unfilterable attribute, or a `has(...)` comparison whose value is not valid JSON, now returns a 422 naming the `filter` parameter instead of a 500.
      * Creating an experiment no longer converts an existing tracing project with the same name. Rename the experiment or choose a new project name when a conflict exists.
      * Scrolling through large experiment comparison results no longer re-fetches the first page of examples on every lazy-load, cutting redundant network traffic and reducing load time.

      ## Monitoring and alerting

      * Chart headers on dashboards no longer overflow or wrap when the title or description is long, the description now truncates with a hover tooltip that reveals the full text. The expand-chart action also picks up the standard icon-button hover treatment.
      * Alert previews now treat integer metadata and its string representation consistently with alert evaluation.

      ## Engine

      * Disabling Engine for an organization or pausing it for a project now offers a short prompt asking why, with an optional comment. It takes one tap and goes straight to the team building Engine.
      * Engine spend controls now explain that new runs pause at the monthly limit while runs already in progress may finish and increase billed spend beyond it.
      * The Engine tab is visible again on tracing projects before Engine is turned on, so admins can enable it, members can request access, and personal organizations can upgrade, all from the tab itself.
      * Engine GitHub settings now link to setup instructions for LangSmith Cloud and self-hosted deployments, with clearer guidance when a connection fails.
      * Engine scans on non-coding-agent boards apply the configured priority chips, user instructions, and trace-scope filter instead of reviewing the whole project.
      * Engine issue descriptions now preserve Markdown paragraph boundaries so updates, additional symptoms, and corrections remain easy to scan.

      ## Feedback and evaluation

      * Feedback corrections can now reset a score to its original value, including zero.
      * Group by metadata and metadata columns are selectable again in the experiment comparison view.
      * A long evaluator name in a feedback card's Source row now truncates instead of extending past the card, and a corrected score keeps its edit control clear of the paging arrows when a key has several entries.
      * Switching a feedback value to a different category now saves even when both categories map to the same numeric score. Previously the change was silently dropped on run details and in annotation queue rubrics.
      * The pencil for correcting an evaluator score is now hidden unless you have permission to update feedback. Previously it appeared for anyone who could see the score, and saving the correction failed.
      * LangSmith now rejects credential-bearing and non-GitHub remote URLs when rendering evaluation commit links.
      * Attachments stored on a run now appear when you review it in an annotation queue, including pairwise queues. Previously only media inlined in the run's inputs or outputs was shown.
      * The evaluator spend table keeps the All runs filter badge inactive when an evaluator has no filters.
      * Daily evaluator spend, weekly totals, and spend limit monitoring on the Evaluators page now respect the currently selected application, instead of showing data across all applications.
      * The evaluator spend chart once again keeps its evaluator and project/dataset grouping control in the chart header for easier access.

      ## Tracing and observability

      * Chat model runs sent through the gateway's unified endpoint with provider/model slugs now match model pricing rules, producing accurate trace costs.
      * Insights reports only analyze traces, so the "Is Trace" condition in a report's filter is now fixed. Setting it to false previously produced a report that ran successfully but never found any insights.
      * LangSmith Chat now respects the Provider API setting on workspace OpenAI model configurations. Models configured for the Responses API no longer fall back to Chat Completions, which made newer reasoning models fail when a reasoning effort was set.
      * Large PDF, JSON, and CSV previews on a message now render instead of showing an empty frame, and PDF and JSON previews gained an open-in-new-tab control next to the expand control.
      * Trace views now source token and feedback stats from SmithDB without attempting unavailable ClickHouse queries.
      * Waterfall filters in thread details now keep deeply nested matches visible and preserve filter controls while newly ingested traces are still appearing.
      * LangSmith MCP's `fetch_runs` tool can now include invocation parameters, including the tool and function schemas sent to an LLM, for easier tool-calling diagnosis.
      * PDF attachment icons now align consistently with other file types in attachment lists.
      * The thread query API now supports trace, run-tree, and thread-level filter expressions through `trace_filter`, `tree_filter`, and `thread_filter`.
      * Public shared-trace links now show a 'temporarily unavailable, try again' message when the trace query times out, instead of the misleading 'trace not found, ask the owner to re-share' message.
      * Clicking a starter prompt without the selected model's API key configured now shows the add-a-key form, the same as typing a message, instead of failing the request.

      ## Prompts and playground

      * Claude models on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform now load successfully in the Playground when no credentials secret is configured, matching existing Gemini behavior under GCP Workload Identity or AWS IRSA.
      * The Prompts page now supports filtering by prompt type, prompt tags, and commit tags, so you can quickly narrow the list down to the prompts you're looking for.
      * Model configurations now show an inline error, instead of a silent save, when a required Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, or Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform provider field is left blank.
      * Studio's chat pane no longer shows a 'No data' placeholder between sending a message and the first streamed token. The assistant message now appears once it has content to show.
      * The Playground now reports missing AWS credentials and other Bedrock rejections as request errors with the provider's own message, instead of a generic server error.
      * Studio chat now shows elapsed response status, preserves complete streamed responses, and follows new output without interrupting readers who scroll up.

      ## Automations

      * Manually triggering an automation rule through the API now works. `POST /runs/rules/{rule_id}/trigger` and the `rule_ids` form of `POST /runs/rules/trigger` previously returned a 500 for every request.
      * You can manually trigger any automation in your workspace, including webhook-only, alert-only, and extend-retention rules. Previously the trigger endpoint only recognized a subset of actions and returned not found for the rest.
      * Online evaluators configured with an OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible custom endpoint now use that endpoint's own URL and API key on live traces instead of failing with an authentication error. Evaluators on custom endpoints are not counted toward evaluator spend limits.

      ## Deployment

      * Self-hosted deployment forms now support Redis CPU and memory requests and limits. The configured values are applied to the Redis workload managed by the Kubernetes operator.
      * Deployments that use a platform-default LangGraph API version now correctly reuse matching images instead of starting unnecessary rebuilds.
      * Managed Deep Agent deployments entering public preview report their normal deployment usage.
      * Rolling back a deployment that was created from an uploaded source archive now redeploys that revision's archive instead of the most recent one.
      * A Managed Deep Agent deployment's Details sidebar now links to the Context Hub repo holding its deployed instructions, skills, and memories. Archived repos are labelled so it is clear when the context is no longer live.

      ## Sandboxes

      * Resuming a suspended sandbox now checks your organization's real sandbox quota, including plan-specific limits, instead of the default cap. Requests that genuinely exceed quota return 429 with a quota message rather than 502 Bad Gateway.
      * Self-hosted LangSmith now enables sandbox API and UI access only when the deployment license includes sandbox access.
      * Online self-hosted LangSmith installations now report finalized sandbox uptime and resource usage for billing when phone-home usage reporting is enabled. Offline and opted-out installations do not send sandbox usage.

      ## Administration

      * The organization submenu now opens when you hover over the organization row in the footer menu.
      * Self-hosted deployments refresh their license every 5 minutes instead of every 24 hours, so entitlement changes take effect shortly after they are made. A failed refresh no longer restarts the service, it keeps using the last verified license until that license's own expiry. The tuning knob is now LICENSE\_REFRESH\_INTERVAL\_SECONDS (default 300), replacing LICENSE\_REFRESH\_INTERVAL\_HOURS.
      * Searching workspaces with Cmd+K now highlights the query in the organization heading, making it clear why a term that matches an organization name returns all of that organization's workspaces.
      * The account menu now offers Get help. Enterprise users can submit a support request in LangSmith, while other cloud users are directed to the Support Portal.
      * The Plans and pricing page now preserves browser back and forward trackpad gestures and centers the plan cards.

      ## LLM Gateway

      * Requests to moonshotai/kimi-k3 and moonshotai/kimi-k2.6 through gateway credit models in the LLM gateway are now matched against a price map when sent in user-traced code.
      * LLM Gateway Usage now provides interactive spend legends, consistent chart layouts, and tooltips that stay visible. Single-series views clearly explain spend that is not affiliated with a user instead of showing an empty chart.
      * You can now purchase as little as \$4.50 in Gateway Credits, equivalent to 3 LCUs.
      * Bedrock requests through the LLM gateway now use the Amazon Bedrock price map so their costs are calculated correctly.
      * The credit balance now shows above the connect card, and the shortcut cards for cost controls, model fallbacks, and spend monitoring stay visible (locked, with an "Upgrade plan" prompt) instead of disappearing for Developer-plan orgs.
      * The Cost Controls, Rate Limiting, and Model Fallbacks tabs now explain what isn't in force yet, with a create button and a docs link above the policy tables. Each tab's create button, dialog title, and submit button also share one label, such as "Create spend limit" instead of a generic "Create policy".
    </Update>

    <Update label="July 27-31, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * LangSmith exposes annotation queue item endpoints for adding, listing, updating, deleting, counting, positioning, and reviewing run or thread queue items through the public API and SDK generation flow.
      * Uploading a .csv or .jsonl dataset now works regardless of the Content-Type the browser reports. Windows browsers label .csv files as an Excel type, which previously caused valid uploads to fail. Uppercase filenames such as DATASET.CSV are also accepted.
      * Evaluator lists on a dataset or tracing project now show an evaluator's current name instead of the name it had when it was attached. Feedback keys are unchanged by a rename.
      * Metadata columns in the experiment comparison grid, including `example.metadata.<key>`, now render their values instead of staying empty.
      * LangSmith marks every legacy endpoint replaced by the SmithDB SDK migration guide as deprecated: the v1 runs query and retrieve endpoints, the v1 run sharing and public-run read endpoints, `POST /api/v1/datasets/{dataset_id}/runs`, and the annotation queue run endpoints. All of them now respond with `Deprecation: true`, a `Sunset` date of January 31, 2027, and a `Link` header pointing at the migration guide and, where a single replacement exists, the successor endpoint. [Learn more](/langsmith/smithdb-sdk-migration).
      * Dataset experiment tables can sort by feedback score when SmithDB queries are enabled and ClickHouse queries are disabled.
      * Annotation queue item APIs use project\_id for the tracing project. Request bodies also accept session\_id as an alias.
      * Dataset example views restore clear spacing between the example details and tab navigation.
      * Pairwise annotation queue runs again include the tracing project id needed to create feedback when ClickHouse query support is disabled.
      * Correcting an evaluator score from the experiment results grid now updates the cell and its popover right away instead of requiring a page refresh.
      * The Configure Evaluator pane's header and templates navigation again paint the same background as the pane itself in dark mode.
      * Dataset and run attachments now resolve relative signed download URLs before previewing, opening, or downloading them in self-hosted deployments.

      ### Monitoring and alerting

      * Adds a reusable ChartCard component to the LangSmith design system, standardizing chart titles, move, expand, and overflow actions, responsive full-width layouts, and chart and legend spacing.

      ### Engine

      * A resolved issue on an Engine Issue Board now returns to Open as soon as Engine links a new matching trace to it. Previously the trace was filed as evidence but the issue stayed closed, so a problem that came back never resurfaced on the board. Dismissed issues stay dismissed.
      * The issue detail header now renders category and tag badges on the same line as the title instead of stacking them underneath, tightening the header and reducing wasted vertical space.
      * The "Engine failed to complete a run" trigger is no longer offered when configuring a Slack channel or webhook destination on an issue board. Destinations already subscribed to it keep receiving those notifications.
      * Engine run webhooks and sandbox links now resolve the externally reachable API base from LANGSMITH\_PUBLIC\_API\_ENDPOINT, falling back to LANGCHAIN\_PLATFORM\_ENDPOINT and then LANGCHAIN\_ENDPOINT. Installs whose chart set only LANGSMITH\_PUBLIC\_API\_ENDPOINT were building relative URLs, which made every non-shadow Engine run fail because the run webhook was rejected as a loopback address.

      ### Tracing

      * Trace detail panes once again use an elevated background that matches their section headers.
      * Bulk exports accept a new opt-in `feedbacks` column that carries each run's individual feedback entries, with their key and comment, as a JSON array. Add `feedbacks` to `export_fields` when creating an export; exports that omit `export_fields` keep their existing columns.
      * Delete an entire trace from the run details actions menu after confirming the destructive action.
      * Negative feedback-key filters now return matching traces correctly when ClickHouse uses optimized runs tables.
      * When a project configures a custom output renderer, the trace Output section now offers it as a Custom option alongside Markdown, Plain, JSON, and YAML instead of replacing them. Custom stays the default, and your choice is remembered.
      * Tracing project activity and sorting stay up to date for self-hosted deployments using Redis versions before 6.2.
      * `POST /api/v1/runs/stats` now returns a 404 when the requested tracing project does not exist in your workspace, and reports other client errors, such as a `start_time` older than the supported lookback window, with their real status and message instead of a generic 500 internal server error.
      * Self-hosted deployments now catch up missing tracing project last-run timestamps so project sorting reflects recent historical activity.
      * Run filters now support total, prompt, and completion token counts and costs consistently across routed query backends.
      * Token Count / Cost filters now default to total tokens / cost instead of input tokens. Input and output token / cost breakdowns remain available in the selector.
      * On a tracing project, resetting a view now moves the Threads/Traces/Runs switcher back in step with the rows being shown. Previously the switcher could stay on Runs while the table had already returned to traces.

      ### Feedback

      * The annotation queue item endpoints are now documented at their served path under /api/v1/platform, so the generated SDK methods for listing, adding, updating, counting, deleting, and placing queue items reach the API instead of returning 404.
      * PDFs and other documents attached to a message now render in a full-width preview frame with a header control that opens them nearly full screen, instead of collapsing to a thumbnail-sized box.

      ### Prompts and playground

      * When a model provider rejects a playground run, such as a wrong API key or an exhausted quota, the playground now shows the provider's own error message instead of a generic server error, so the cause is clear from the error itself.
      * Playground batch and invoke endpoints now sanitize buffered run trees into JSON-safe payloads before responding, so online evaluations no longer fail with opaque 500s when a run graph cannot be serialized.

      ### Automations

      * Forking an evaluator attaches the copy to the project or dataset named in the fork dialog. Previously the copy could be created attached to nothing, leaving the original evaluator running the version you had just edited away from.

      ## Deployment

      * The Create New Deployment form now shows a clear, per-field message when a submitted value fails validation (e.g. an invalid image path) instead of the raw backend error payload.
      * Deleting a tracing project whose LangGraph deployment is still within its post-deletion retention window now schedules the project to be removed along with the deployment, and explains that in the error message instead of asking you to delete a deployment you already deleted.
      * The delete confirmation for a LangGraph deployment now says that cleanup of the underlying database runs after you confirm, and that a deleted deployment's name stays reserved until that cleanup finishes.

      ## Sandboxes

      * Sandboxes accept a new streaming execute request that returns stdout and stderr as Server-Sent Events, for clients that cannot hold a WebSocket. Passing a command ID reuses a running command, and a separate resume request continues an interrupted stream instead of running the command again.
      * Sandboxes now ship with the `langsmith` CLI on PATH, so agents can query traces, runs, and datasets without installing it first.
      * Sandbox and snapshot rows now use single-column layouts with actions in context menus, snapshot sources remain available in their menus, and wrapped names stay left-aligned.
      * Engine sandbox commands in self-hosted deployments now authenticate over WebSocket with the deployment service key, preventing 401 failures after successful sandbox creation.
      * The `langsmith` CLI in sandboxes is updated to v0.2.44. Its requests now resolve on self-hosted deployments that serve the API under `/api`, where commands such as `trace messages` and the project issues commands previously failed.

      ## Administration

      * The LangSmith home page now provides quick access to copy the current organization and workspace IDs.
      * On self-hosted installations authenticating with OAuth/SSO, the Remote MCP authorization endpoint returned a 400 because the SSO login route shadowed it. OAuth clients can now complete the authorize step and connect to the Remote MCP server.
      * Self-hosted deployments with an online license key (beacon access) now see the monthly organization usage graph automatically, without needing the enable\_monthly\_usage\_charts org config. Offline deployments are now pointed to the Granular usage tab for locally-recorded billable usage.
      * Switching workspaces or organizations keeps you on the same page when the route has no workspace-specific resource IDs. Routes that reference a specific resource continue to open the destination workspace home page.
      * LangSmith now refreshes expired browser sessions and retries interrupted API requests before asking you to log in again.

      ### LLM Gateway

      * Gateway policies with a blank or whitespace-only name now fall back to showing the policy ID instead of rendering an empty name cell, and the policy update endpoint now rejects blank names the same way creation already does.
      * The Gateway usage spend chart now shows the top 12 individual spenders per bucket, rolling the rest into an "Other" series, and its hover tooltip lists every contributor at once with the bucket total pinned beneath them.
      * The home page onboarding flow now includes a step for choosing how your agent reaches a model: bring your own provider API key, or use Gateway Credits. Choosing Gateway Credits lets an organization admin pre-purchase prepaid credit and shows the API key and gateway URL needed to start sending traffic, with no provider account required.
      * The custom X-Gateway-\* header condition on LLM Gateway spend-cap and rate-limit policies now works with organization-, workspace-, and user-scoped policies too, not just API-key-scoped ones, so you can split a single subject's traffic into separate caps by header value regardless of how the policy is scoped.
      * Default spend cap and rate limit policies in LLM Gateway now expand to show the per-user, per-workspace, and per-API-key policies materialized underneath them.
      * The Gateway Credits purchase dialog now shows the credit balance your purchase will land you on, and states the fee-inclusive total directly above a single purchase button. Large amounts no longer push the credits readout and total outside the dialog.
      * Enterprise organizations without Data Protection now see the tab in the LLM Gateway, greyed out with a link to request access, instead of the tab being hidden entirely.
      * The connect card now appears above the Gateway Credits balance on the LLM Gateway Home page, and the generated code snippets list the API key before the base URL to match common convention.
      * Generating an API key from the LLM Gateway Home connect card now shows the standard one-time key reveal dialog, and each provider's "Configured" status now reflects the workspace's actual secrets instead of a fixed list.
      * The "Purchase Credits" button on LLM Gateway Home now opens the credit purchase dialog instead of showing a "coming soon" message, and the balance bar now shows spend against what's actually purchased instead of against the plan's purchase limit.
      * The Cost Controls and Model Fallbacks shortcuts on LLM Gateway Home now read "View cost controls"/"View model fallbacks" for members who can't manage the org, instead of "Manage"/"Configure".
      * Gateway Home code samples now use the gateway hostname constructed for each LangSmith region and default to the Responses API where supported. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
      * LLM Gateway policy tabs now clarify that policies apply across the organization, while Usage clarifies that spend is scoped to the selected workspace.
      * The home onboarding step now states your Gateway Credits balance in US dollars, matching the amount you purchase, instead of converting it to LCUs.
      * The prompt you copy into your coding agent during onboarding now states how the agent should reach a model, based on the provider you picked: Gateway Credits, or your own provider API key.
      * Homepage spacing and surface tinting now match design review feedback, and several small copy fixes clarify credit limits, provider status, and organization-level purchase limits.
      * LLM Gateway Home again includes Google Gemini and generates valid model identifiers for Gemini and Baseten connect samples. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
      * LLM Gateway Home now highlights the selected model and lets you switch connect samples between Chat Completions, Messages, and Responses formats.
      * The LLM Gateway Usage tab now explains when usage queries aren't available for a deployment instead of showing failed dashboard requests.
      * When you select Gateway Credits during onboarding, the prompt copied into your coding agent now includes the correct Gateway URL for your deployment. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
      * Gateway Credits checkout now remains on the active purchase step while a free workspace upgrades to the Developer plan, instead of briefly showing the saved-card view before closing.
      * Requests that set prompt\_cache\_options (or the deprecated prompt\_cache\_retention) now enable Anthropic prompt caching when the LLM Gateway translates an OpenAI Chat Completions or Responses request to a Claude model, instead of ignoring the field. Anthropic's default cache lifetime applies, and prompt\_cache\_key, prompt\_cache\_retention, and prompt\_cache\_options are all preserved when translating between the Chat Completions and Responses formats.
      * Tooltips on disabled LLM Gateway policy controls now read "You need organization admin access to create policies" instead of referencing the raw organization:manage permission string.
      * The Gateway Usage tab no longer shows an in-page workspace dropdown. The page is already scoped to your current workspace, and its subtitle now names that workspace directly.
    </Update>

    <Update label="July 20-24, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * `GET /annotation-queues/{id}/items` now returns THREAD queue items alongside RUN items, with an optional item\_type filter. THREAD list rows expose identity on the item (thread\_id/session\_id/start\_time) and omit nested thread; RUN list still hydrates nested run for now (same omit planned for metadata-only list). Traces and messages load via the v2 threads APIs when reviewing.
      * `GET /annotation-queues/{id}/runs` and related size endpoints exclude THREAD queue rows (run\_id is null) so mixed queues no longer return 500. Use GET /items for thread listing.
      * Project settings now require a thread idle time of at least two minutes to ensure thread evaluations include all ingested runs.
      * Annotation queue item add requests now consistently enforce a 100-item limit for runs and threads. Over-limit errors clearly show the configured limit.
      * `GET /annotation-queues/{id}/items` returns Postgres membership metadata for RUN and THREAD items without hydrating nested run or thread payloads from ClickHouse or SmithDB. Orphan queue rows remain listed. The include\_stats query parameter is removed. Annotate payloads load via get-one / review APIs.
      * When you bulk-add runs from a tracing project, its default dataset now appears first in the dataset picker.
      * Annotation queue review lists now label unnamed run rows as `Run <ID>`, matching thread rows and making mixed queues easier to scan.
      * Opening the pairwise experiment comparison from a pairwise annotation queue no longer crashes the page when both compared runs come from the same experiment.

      ### Tracing

      * The Insights reports pane can now be collapsed to give report details more space.
      * Insights cluster summary columns can now expand to show more of each summary.
      * LangSmith MCP's `fetch_runs` tool now returns `first_token_time` when that value is recorded for fetched runs, making TTFT analysis available without a separate SDK query.
      * Legacy run URLs now resolve the run metadata and redirect to the SmithDB trace view instead of showing an error.
      * Trace usage limit banners now appear only for workspace members whose user-scoped limit has been exceeded.
      * The Deployment button on tracing project pages now opens the deployment page within the app instead of reloading the UI.
      * Clicking the already-selected run or trace in a thread's trace tree now keeps it selected instead of deselecting it and scrolling back to the first trace.
      * Fixed two frontend call sites that could reach POST /runs/stats with an empty or missing session, preventing spurious 422 errors in the Insights job config and session rules form.
      * MCP run query tools now return gateway timeout responses without retrying, reducing duplicate load when a run query times out.
      * Pressing Enter to confirm characters from an input method editor (e.g. Pinyin for Chinese, or Japanese/Korean IMEs) in LangSmith Chat now commits the composed text instead of prematurely sending the message.
      * LangSmith Chat now surfaces a run's system prompt inline when reading a traced LLM run, so it can explain why a model behaved a certain way without missing the system prompt. It also recognizes system prompts stored as provider-level fields (OpenAI Responses `instructions`, Anthropic `system`).
      * LangSmith Chat traces now show the model you configured instead of mislabeling it as GPT-3.5-Turbo when a custom model endpoint is used.
      * The Run in Studio button is now hidden on public (shared) run pages, where it previously pointed to an authenticated page that shared viewers cannot open.
      * Navigating between traces now clears stale sharing state, so unshared traces no longer appear public.
      * The run, trace, and thread detail panels now enforce a minimum width when resized, so their header no longer overflows and forces the view to scroll sideways.
      * Restore `is_in_dataset` on trace and run responses when the query is proxied to the V1 backend in ClickHouse-only mode. The V1 select now forwards `in_dataset` so the Python backend computes it and the proxy renames it back to `is_in_dataset` for V2 callers.
      * BYOC workspaces now avoid requesting trace table fields that older data planes do not support, preventing invalid request errors when viewing traces.
      * Custom dashboard charts can now query summed latency and first-token time metrics through the runs analytics SmithDB path.
      * Custom dashboard charts can now query minimum and maximum latency, time-to-first-token, token, and cost values through SmithDB-backed runs analytics.
      * Custom dashboard charts can now query P90 and P95 for latency, first token time, tokens, and cost metrics, in addition to the existing P50 and P99.
      * Custom dashboard charts can now aggregate feedback scores by sum, P50, P90, P95, and P99, in addition to the existing average, min, and max.
      * The LangSmith homepage now provides clearer onboarding steps for coding agents and tracing, including a direct shortcut for creating a tracing project.

      ### Prompts and playground

      * Editing agent and skill metadata in the Context Hub now shows save progress, reports actionable errors without discarding changes, and displays successful updates immediately.
      * Prompts with a repo readme now display it in a dedicated Readme section of the prompt view.
      * Gemini 3.6 Flash and Gemini 3.5 Flash Lite are now available in Fleet, Agent Builder, and playground model selectors, with usage pricing support.
      * Pasting content into rich-text editors, such as the prompt playground and agent chat, now works reliably again.
      * Previewing a single dataset row after running a full experiment now resolves the row's evaluator scores instead of showing a feedback cell that loads indefinitely, and the resulting feedback chips render with their proper colors.
      * LangSmith no longer keeps system-added top\_p values when switching OpenAI prompts to reasoning models, preventing invalid invocation parameters. Users who still need top\_p can add it as an extra model parameter for supported non-reasoning models.

      ### Engine

      * The organization Engine usage page now lets you switch between a workspaces view and a projects view of month-to-date LCU spend, each ranked by spend. The Engine spend API returns the authoritative total independently of the breakdown.
      * Engine no longer shows redundant hover tooltips on issue category badges or the default Fix action. Permission and PR status explanations still appear when they add context.
      * Engine opens the Slack or webhook destination form immediately when no destinations are configured.
      * Engine issue category labels now appear on a dedicated row below the title for more consistent spacing and readability.
      * Engine now shows a warning beside a linked repository when it cannot access it, including failures caused by renamed or deleted repositories and broken GitHub connections.
      * On an Engine issue, navigating to the next or previous linked trace now stays in the conversation view for traces that belong to a thread, instead of switching to the single-trace view.
      * Engine now shows a clickable Paused status in the issues header when scheduled scanning is paused, so you can see its status and open settings directly.
      * Engine now works in supported self-hosted deployments without Eppo rollout configuration, while organization enablement and existing permissions remain enforced.
      * Opening the project spend limit from the pause confirmation now scrolls the settings pane to the limit editor.
      * Engine Overview now displays the current Engine package version so you can see when the underlying experience changes.

      ### Monitoring and alerting

      * Self-hosted alert webhook delivery now honors `SSRF_ALLOW_K8S_INTERNAL`, so internal Kubernetes service hostnames can be used when that setting is enabled. Metadata endpoints, localhost, and private IP protections remain controlled by their existing SSRF policy settings.

      ### Automations

      * Thread (grouped) evaluators now require a minimum idle time of 120 seconds. Setting a project's thread idle time below 120s is rejected.
      * Leaving feedback on a run in a thread now makes the thread eligible for re-evaluation, so thread-level evaluators re-run when new feedback arrives.
      * Editing an online evaluator (LLM-as-judge or custom code) no longer intermittently fails when sandbox validation is slow.

      ## Deployment

      * Worker and API server CPU charts now plot a peak (max) series alongside the average, so a single replica with high CPU usage is no longer hidden by the fleet-wide average.
      * Worker and API server memory charts now plot a peak (max) series alongside the average, so a single replica approaching its memory limit is no longer hidden by the fleet-wide average.
      * Creating a deployment with a name that's already in use within your workspace now returns a 409 Conflict instead of a 500 error.
      * Hybrid deployments remain compatible with older listeners during control-plane upgrades, preventing new deployments from remaining queued.

      ## Sandboxes

      * A sandbox proxy configuration can now define environment variables that are applied to every command in the sandbox. This is handy when a tool refuses to run unless a credential env var is present (for example gh needs GH\_TOKEN) even though the egress proxy injects the real credential on the wire. Set a placeholder value so the command starts.
      * Attach free-form key/value labels when creating a sandbox or snapshot. Labels are stored and returned on reads; sandboxes inherit their snapshot's labels, and snapshots built from a Docker image inherit the image's labels.
      * Sandbox network egress now tries every resolved IP for a destination instead of only the first, so requests to multi-homed hosts (for example apt package mirrors) no longer fail when the first address is unreachable on the requested port.
      * Creating a sandbox with only mem\_bytes set now derives a matching CPU allocation automatically, so requests for larger-memory sandboxes no longer need an explicit vcpus value to satisfy the CPU-to-memory ratio.

      ## Administration

      * Selecting All Workspaces on the Granular Billable Usage page now loads usage successfully for organizations with many workspaces.
      * The Granular Usage page now shows a notice that long-lived trace usage isn't tracked in self-hosted deployments, so the "Long-lived only" filter is expected to show zero results there.

      ### LLM Gateway

      * Gateway Monitoring now shows spend for the workspace you're viewing rather than the whole organization, with a dropdown to switch workspaces from the page. Spend cards show N/A instead of a repeated error message when a workspace's gateway project can't be resolved.
      * The Rate Limiting tab in Gateway Policies now supports creating, editing, deleting, and enabling/disabling request- and token-based rate-limit policies, alongside the existing cost-control and data-protection policy management.
      * Editing a materialized LLM Gateway policy now turns it into a standalone override, preventing later default policy changes from overwriting its custom limits.
      * You can now call LangChain-managed models through the LLM gateway without configuring your own provider credentials. Usage is metered at cost and bounded by a monthly spend cap based on your plan; once the cap is reached, further requests are blocked until the next month. The cap can be raised on request. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway-langchain-provider).
      * Selecting an entity filter on the LLM Gateway spend monitoring page no longer flips the breakdown to a different dimension.
      * Selecting more than one entity in any Gateway Monitoring breakdown filter (model, user, or API key) now returns spend for all chosen entities instead of no data.
      * The Gateway Monitoring spend chart now formats axis labels and tooltip ranges in UTC to match its UTC-anchored buckets, so viewers in non-UTC timezones no longer see off-by-one dates.
      * The LLM Gateway spend chart and table now label spend from service keys as "Unaffiliated with any user" instead of showing a blank name, with a tooltip explaining that the spend came from a workspace/org-scoped key rather than an individual.
      * API-key-scoped LLM Gateway spend-cap and rate-limit policies can now add a custom X-Gateway-\* header condition, so a single API key can match different limits per header value. For example, a reseller can set separate caps per downstream customer without distributing multiple keys.
      * Stat card and table headers in the LLM Gateway monitoring page's Spend tab (e.g. "Total Spend", "Daily Avg", "API Key") now capitalize every word, matching the header style used elsewhere in the product.
      * When a specific start/end date is selected in the LLM Gateway monitoring page's date range picker, the button now shows the dates in UTC and appends "(UTC)" so it's clear the range doesn't follow your local timezone. Relative ranges like "Last 7 days" are unaffected.
      * The "Spend share" column on the LLM Gateway Monitoring spend dashboard no longer cuts off its header text.
      * The LLM Gateway now lives in a dedicated top-level sidebar section instead of under Settings, with a new Home tab listing your custom model configurations and a ready-to-run code snippet for the gateway. Old Settings gateway links redirect automatically.
      * A Home banner for LangSmith Cloud orgs with LLM Gateway enabled highlights how Gateway manages costs and improves runtime reliability. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
    </Update>

    <Update label="July 13-17, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * The legacy feedback formula endpoints (`POST/GET /feedback/formulas` and `GET/PUT/DELETE /feedback/formulas/{feedback_formula_id}`) that back composite scores are deprecated in favor of [composite evaluators](/langsmith/composite-evaluators-ui), which implement a composite score as a code evaluator plus a run rule, and are scheduled for removal on 2026-08-20. Migrate existing feedback formulas to the new composite model.
      * Expanding the run tree for repetition runs in [experiment comparison](/langsmith/compare-experiment-results) views now works reliably when a repetition root has a project ID but no session ID.
      * POST /v2/datasets//experiment-runs is the supported public API for paginated experiment comparison. Legacy dataset comparison helpers are removed from the public OpenAPI spec and generated SDKs; existing HTTP routes continue to work for LangSmith UI clients.
      * Adds `langsmith evaluator create-llm` to define structured LLM-as-judge evaluator rules from a prompt, schema, and model config file, targeting a project or dataset.
      * Creating [dataset examples](/langsmith/manage-datasets) from [source runs](/langsmith/manage-datasets) now correctly fetches run inputs and outputs backed by SmithDB, and no longer fails the whole request if one of several source runs can't be found.
      * Multi-turn evaluators now include a Test action that runs the evaluator against a sample thread before you save the rule.
      * Add RUN items to a single [annotation queue](/langsmith/annotation-queues) with POST /annotation-queues//items. The server resolves runs via ClickHouse or SmithDB and returns a standards-shaped items envelope; THREAD support follows in a later release.
      * The LangSmith CLI now updates existing code evaluator rules in place when `evaluator upload --replace` is used, avoiding a delete-before-create window if the replacement upload fails.
      * Split the read datasets into a new download datasets permission.  Enforce this new permission in both the application and in APIs.  The download button is disabled for those users without the download permission. [Learn more](/langsmith/organization-workspace-operations#datasets).
      * Public dataset experiment traces open correctly when experiment runs provide their project identifier through the v2 response shape.
      * A run rule with a 0 sampling rate processes no runs, but the scheduler still enumerated it every tick. The scheduler query now skips rules with sampling\_rate 0 (parity with the is\_enabled check), so they are never dispatched.
      * Dataset and experiment tables now truncate long input and reference-output text and show detected base64 images as small thumbnails with a delayed larger preview, avoiding oversized hidden DOM content.
      * Experiment tables now defer full payload rendering and output diff preparation until those views are requested, improving responsiveness for runs with large agent trajectories.
      * Public dataset share links now resolve the sessions list (with stats) from SmithDB when ClickHouse querying is disabled, so shared dataset pages no longer fail to load on SmithDB-only deployments.
      * Add conversation threads to a single [annotation queue](/langsmith/annotation-queues) with POST /annotation-queues//items using item\_type THREAD (thread\_id + session\_id). Mixed RUN and THREAD batches are supported; the server resolves threads via ClickHouse or SmithDB.
      * Code evaluators now get more time to run each batch, so evaluators that import heavy libraries like scikit-learn are less likely to time out.
      * POST /annotation-queues//items now accepts at most 200 items per request and returns a clear validation error when the limit is exceeded. Requests at the limit continue to succeed.
      * Applying an evaluator to an existing experiment could fail with "Failed to start evaluation" on large experiments. It now starts reliably even when the run count is temporarily unavailable.
      * Linked runs load correctly from public dataset shares when LangSmith uses the ClickHouse compatibility path.

      ### Tracing

      * The tracing and evaluation onboarding quickstarts now show the correct LANGSMITH\_ENDPOINT for bring-your-own-cloud data plane workspaces instead of the shared multi-tenant endpoint.
      * Bulk export compression now defaults to zstandard (zstd) for improved performance. Self-hosted environments retain the gzip default via the FF\_BULK\_EXPORT\_DEFAULT\_COMPRESSION environment variable.
      * [LangSmith MCP tools](/langsmith/langsmith-mcp-server) that fetch runs or thread history now accept project UUIDs in addition to project names, making trace URL investigations faster and less error-prone.
      * OpenTelemetry resource attributes (set via OTEL\_RESOURCE\_ATTRIBUTES) now appear on traces as metadata namespaced under otel.resource.\*, so you can attach details like user IDs without changing how your tracer emits spans.
      * LLM spans in the trace view now show the model provider's brand logo (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google/Gemini, Azure, Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, and speech providers), resolved from the run's ls\_provider metadata.
      * Fixed a bug where non-primitive metadata values did not appear in run details.
      * Run stats scoped to an explicit run-id list (for example Insights per-cluster stats) now compute on SmithDB, which scopes results to those runs instead of falling back to project-wide totals.
      * Organization model settings now let you search pricing rules by model name, match rule, or provider. Paginated loading fetches additional rules as you scroll, making large numbers of model price maps manageable.
      * Assistant messages carrying tool calls were rendered twice in the v2 messages view for traces produced by the @anthropic-ai/sdk JavaScript SDK. Dedup now normalizes content-block field order so the same message emitted as an LLM output and replayed as an input on the next turn collapses to a single row.
      * Run errors whose stack trace arrived fully escaped (no real line breaks) now render as properly formatted multi-line text instead of one long wrapped line.
      * LangSmith MCP's `fetch_runs` tool now accepts `min_start_time` and `max_start_time` arguments, so agents can search traces outside the default recent window.
      * Adds a `GET /v2/runs/{run_id}/url` endpoint that returns the LangSmith UI URL for a specific run.

      ### Engine

      * When an [Engine](/langsmith/engine) project reaches its monthly spend limit, the Next Run status chip and project spend card now show a clear "Monthly spend limit reached" state with a button that takes you straight to raising the limit.
      * LangSmith exposes [Engine](/langsmith/engine) issue listing and retrieval through hosted MCP tools and generated SDK methods. Agents and API clients can fetch issue details directly by issue ID or filter issues by project, status, severity, tag, and update time.
      * A new [Engine](/langsmith/engine) board callout points you to the trace-scope setting, where you can restrict Engine's reviews to runs matching a run name or metadata value.
      * The Engine setup screen now shows an estimated monthly cost based on the project's recent trace volume and size, so you know roughly what to expect before starting analysis.
      * The Engine issue list now uses a single filter and sort menu with a compact, nested layout for Priority, Status, Tags, and Sort by, replacing the previous two separate popovers.
      * The [Engine](/langsmith/engine) issue list now shows the active sort order as a removable chip next to your filter chips whenever it differs from the default.
      * Engine issues can now be marked Fixing or Watching, and you can get a Slack alert when new traces recur on a watched issue.
      * The [Engine](/langsmith/engine) issue list no longer shows scan-timing details (next scan countdown, last run time, or a Run now action); a Pause/Resume control remains available in its own section in board settings.
      * Engine now verifies concrete claims in agent responses against trace evidence, improving detection of ungrounded artifacts, values, and claimed actions.

      ### Prompts and playground

      * Playground runs now retain evaluator scores and reasoning while backend feedback updates are polled, preventing completed results from appearing blank.
      * LangSmith now waits for model preset defaults to finish loading before initializing the Playground, preventing OpenAI from replacing a custom default preset during page load.
      * The model configuration default button now switches to a selected state when you make a preset your default.
      * Playground model settings now apply typed custom model names when the selector closes, so you no longer need to click the typed option explicitly.
      * Custom evaluator errors in the Playground results table now reliably show the failure message, instead of sometimes displaying a blank error indicator.
      * Configure workspace-wide HTTPS webhooks for every Context Hub commit, with signed payloads, custom headers, and secret rotation controls.

      ### Feedback

      * Adding runs to an annotation queue via the by-key endpoint now falls back to the ClickHouse run lookup when SmithDB queries are disabled, so the SDK's annotation-queue additions work regardless of whether SmithDB is enabled.
      * The POST /feedback/eager endpoint is deprecated in favor of POST /feedback and is scheduled for removal on 2026-08-10. Update any direct integrations calling /feedback/eager to use POST /feedback instead.
      * Feedback creation now accepts a thread identifier, enabling feedback to be associated with a conversation thread instead of only an individual run or session.
      * GET feedback requests can now filter by a thread ID within a project, making thread-level feedback retrievable without resolving a run first.
      * Annotation queue rubric feedback now loads the thread-scoped feedback for thread queue items.
      * Annotation queue rubric feedback now saves against the selected thread for thread queue items.

      ### Monitoring and alerting

      * When a custom dashboard chart has no data or would produce too many bins, the empty state now surfaces the active stride (e.g. 1M) and selected range (e.g. Last 12 hours) so it's clear what to adjust.
      * When hovering the +N chip in a dashboard chart's legend, the expanded popover now paints above adjacent chart cards instead of being clipped behind them.
      * Metadata grouping keys without returned values no longer show a misleading empty value tooltip in dashboards.

      ### Automations

      * Resolved an unbounded memory leak in the SAQ queue worker where croniter objects were rebuilt every second, accumulating cached entries that were never released. The croniter dependency is bumped to 6.2.2+ and croniter objects are now reused across schedule ticks.

      ## Deployment

      * You can now edit an existing cron's schedule, input, and end time from a deployment's Crons tab, instead of deleting and recreating it.
      * LangSmith frontend images now install nginx 1.31 packages to pick up the latest Chainguard security fixes.
      * Deployment creation now checks free deployment usage with the same backend quota count used during submission, preventing the form from offering a free Serverless or Development option when the organization quota is already used.
      * LangSmith Deployment now lets you update compute and database resource tiers independently for supported hosted deployments. The scaling action applies the selected resources and rolls out a new revision.
      * Hosted project deployment views now label scale-to-zero development deployments as Serverless, with free deployments shown as Serverless (free).
      * The deployment form now shows the free serverless option immediately while checking an organization's remaining deployment allowance.
      * Refines error handling when attempting to create a deployment with no GitHub repository selected.
      * Serverless deployments can now update compute tiers correctly without requiring an external database tier.
      * Self-hosted deployments now authenticate correctly to node-based AWS ElastiCache with IAM in both single-node and cluster configurations.

      ## Sandboxes

      * Sandboxes can now opt into keeping their memory when they stop, so the next start resumes where it left off instead of cold-booting. Set preserve\_memory\_on\_stop when creating a sandbox; it defaults to off.

      ## Administration

      * Workspace switcher labels now show the full workspace name on hover when the visible label is truncated. This makes similarly prefixed workspace names easier to distinguish.
      * Some new users could get stuck on the last onboarding step, with a loading spinner that never finished. This is now fixed.
      * Organization admins can now rename their organization directly from the organization switcher in settings.
      * Organization admins can now generate, view, and delete SCIM bearer tokens directly from Settings > Access and Security, instead of using the API, to set up SCIM provisioning with their identity provider. [Learn more](/langsmith/user-management#set-up-scim-for-your-organization).

      ## Other

      * When you add runs to an [annotation queue](/langsmith/annotation-queues) without specifying `extend_trace_retention`, short-lived traces stay on short-lived retention. Pass `extend_trace_retention=true` to upgrade traces to extended retention.
    </Update>

    <Update label="July 6-10, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * Model, prompt, and tool chips in the Experiments table config cells now lay out from real measurements for accurate truncation, and the +N overflow badge is a clickable dropdown whose entries expose the same actions (filter, group by, open in playground, and details) as a chip's own menu.
      * Evaluators linked to Hub prompts now load correctly for flat and playground-shaped prompt commits, fixing crashes when editing existing evaluators.
      * The experiment comparison view now offers an optional, reorderable "Splits (latest)" column that shows each example's current dataset split assignments as chips, reflecting live membership rather than the as-of-run snapshot.
      * Evaluator spend charts on project and dataset evaluator tabs keep their desktop layout on narrow screens and scroll horizontally instead of compressing the chart and stat cards.
      * The experiment comparison and group-by views now show each example's current dataset split rather than the split it had when the experiment ran, so you can tell whether failures already belong to a split without re-running the experiment.
      * Comparison view now loads token and cost stats from SmithDB for root runs, so the stats columns populate again instead of staying blank
      * LangSmith now caps reusable evaluators per workspace to prevent unbounded resource growth. Contact support if your workspace needs a higher limit.
      * Creating dataset examples from source runs now correctly fetches run inputs and outputs backed by SmithDB, and no longer fails the whole request if one of several source runs can't be found.
      * Select multiple rows in an experiment (or select all matching the current filters) and add, replace, or remove their dataset splits in one action, or copy the selected examples to another dataset, instead of editing rows one at a time.
      * The `/runs/rules/validate` endpoint now supports [thread evaluators](/langsmith/online-evaluations-multi-turn). Pass `test_thread_id` and `session_id` to test a multi-turn evaluator against a real conversation before saving.
      * The thread evaluator config preview now shows the thread message formats the evaluator actually maps, instead of listing every available format.
      * The evaluator config now shows a locked "Trace count ≥ 2" filter for managed thread evaluators, making it clear they only run on threads with multiple turns.
      * Experiment comparison and individual experiment views now load run rows on self-hosted deployments that authenticate the UI via SSO/OAuth session cookies. Previously these views could show 'No results found' even though metrics and feedback loaded.
      * Experiment statistics now refresh promptly for recently run experiments while keeping historical experiment scans bounded.
      * The Assertions evaluator added via "Add evaluator" now reads assertions from the reference output like the auto-attached version, so it grades against the real assertions instead of always failing.
      * Evaluator spend chart y-axes now abbreviate amounts of \$1,000 or more, making high-spend values easier to scan.
      * A run rule whose sampling rate was 0 (or unset) sent an out-of-range sample\_rate to the SmithDB query service (which rejected it) and zeroed out ClickHouse thread grouping. Both the flat and grouped fetch paths now fall back to 1.0 (no sampling) so these rules query successfully.
      * Exporting a dataset comparison view as CSV now returns a clear "file is too large to export" error instead of a generic server error when the export exceeds internal size limits.
      * Each split chip in a row's Splits cell is now interactive in the experiment results and comparison views, with an Edit splits action that opens the single-example split picker so you can reassign splits without leaving the table.

      ### Tracing

      * The batched-run ingestion log now emits run\_verbs as a list of run\_id and verbs objects instead of a map keyed by run UUID, preventing structured-log aggregators from exhausting dynamic field limits.
      * Authenticated users viewing public runs now see sidebar navigation for their last selected workspace. Logged-out viewers continue to see the public run without authenticated workspace navigation.
      * LangSmith MCP tools that fetch runs or thread history now accept project UUIDs in addition to project names, making trace URL investigations faster and less error-prone.
      * OpenTelemetry resource attributes (set via `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`) now appear on traces as metadata namespaced under `otel.resource.*`, so you can attach details like user IDs without changing how your tracer emits spans.
      * Native OpenTelemetry child spans are no longer dropped when they arrive before an SDK-attributed parent span; they are buffered and correctly nested regardless of arrival order.
      * Thread pages now show an explicit access-control message when trace loading is denied by ABAC, instead of a generic retrieval error.
      * All time filters in tracing views now query the full retention window instead of falling back to a shorter backend default. This keeps trace, thread, and run results consistent when expanding the time range.
      * OpenTelemetry traces from VS Code Copilot Chat now render as one clean nested trace per user turn. Auxiliary title/summary calls and orphaned tool spans are suppressed, message roles are corrected, token counts are de-duplicated, and standardized metadata (integration, agent runtime, thread ID, repo/git details) is attached automatically.
      * Insights cluster run stats (run count, latency, tokens, and feedback) now reflect only the runs in each cluster instead of showing the same project-wide totals for every cluster.
      * LangSmith Chat now authenticates to Chat LangChain with guest tokens when searching documentation, so docs answers keep working as Chat LangChain tightens authentication.
      * The Trace Messages viewer now identifies the "main" conversation for traces that include middleware guardrails or subagent side-conversations, so the message list shows only the primary interaction instead of interleaving middleware/subagent partitions. Correctness is verified by an expanded snapshot suite covering 11 integrations across LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, Vercel AI SDK, Claude Agent SDK, deepagents, and raw provider wrappers.
      * Custom dashboard charts can now query P50 and P99 for input and output costs without failing runs analytics requests.
      * The thread stats API now accepts a `filter` query parameter, letting you scope aggregated stats to traces matching a LangSmith filter expression (e.g. start time or trace ID).
      * LangSmith Chat now mints Managed Deep Agent guest tokens from the Chat LangChain LangGraph host (`POST /identity/guest`) when searching documentation, instead of the legacy Chat LangChain frontend guest route.

      ### Engine

      * Upgrades the Redis client to improve recovery from Redis cluster topology changes, fixing cases where cluster reconnects could stall.
      * Engine now lets the parent agent recover from model-actionable subtask failures and retries transient provider or network errors before failing a run. This helps issue scans continue through recoverable model errors while preserving hard failures for auth, configuration, and code exceptions.
      * LangSmith exposes Engine issue listing and retrieval through hosted MCP tools and generated SDK methods. Agents and API clients can fetch issue details directly by issue ID or filter issues by project, status, severity, tag, and update time.
      * Engine-generated examples with assertions now add the Assertions evaluator when saved to a dataset from an annotation queue, matching the direct Add offline examples flow.
      * The Engine issue list now uses a single filter and sort menu with a compact, collapsible layout for Priority, Status, Tags, and Sort by, replacing the previous two separate popovers.
      * The Engine issue list now shows the active sort order as a removable chip next to your filter chips whenever it differs from the default.
      * The Engine issue list no longer shows scan-timing details (next scan countdown, last run time, or a Run now action); a Pause/Resume control remains available in its own section in board settings.

      ### Prompts and playground

      * Self-hosted Playground and evaluator outbound model calls now honor proxy environment variables while preserving SSRF validation on every request.
      * Typing a workspace member's name or email in the Context Hub search box now also returns the prompts and resources they created.
      * Playground and evaluator calls to Amazon Bedrock using IAM Trusted Entity now resolve the correct LangSmith AWS credentials before assuming customer roles in AWS-hosted LangSmith. This fixes failures that reported "Failed to assume role" before the customer role was assumed.
      * Outbound model calls that route through a forward proxy now send the original hostname in the proxy CONNECT tunnel instead of a resolved IP, so proxies that allowlist tunnel targets by domain no longer reject them. This fixes self-hosted Playground and evaluator calls to internal OpenAI-compatible endpoints reachable only through such a proxy.
      * Reviewing a prompt commit now displays every extra parameter (such as verbosity) set on the model, not just a fixed subset.

      ### Feedback

      * POST requests to add runs to an annotation queue accept an optional `extend_trace_retention` query parameter. When set to false, short-lived traces are not upgraded to extended retention. The default remains true for backward compatibility.
      * Feedback creation resolves run metadata from SmithDB when the client provides session and start time, so SmithDB-only deployments no longer depend on ClickHouse for eager feedback writes.
      * The `POST /feedback/eager` endpoint is deprecated in favor of `POST /feedback` and is scheduled for removal on 2026-08-10. Update any direct integrations calling `/feedback/eager` to use `POST /feedback` instead.

      ### Monitoring and alerting

      * Dashboard chart tooltips and axes now show up to eight fractional digits (previously two), so very small costs and rates no longer round down to zero.

      ## Deployment

      * The multi-select dropdown (e.g. Selected Tools) on the Studio assistants page now renders above the configuration dialog instead of behind it, so its options are visible and selectable.
      * Redis connections using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure IAM) authentication now re-authenticate automatically before the access token expires, so long-lived connections no longer drop. Clustered Azure Redis is now supported for IAM auth as well.
      * The deployment Crons tab now shows each schedule in your local timezone instead of raw UTC, matching the Next Run Date column.
      * LangSmith Deployment now supports updating a deployment to a fixed resource tier through the control plane API. The update applies the selected tier's resource configuration, resizes Cloud SQL or RDS, and rolls a new revision.
      * You can now rename a deployment from its Settings: give it a friendly display name without recreating it. The deployment's URLs and infrastructure are unchanged.

      ## Sandboxes

      * S3 sandbox mounts now default endpoint\_url to [https://s3.amazonaws.com](https://s3.amazonaws.com) when it is not provided, so the field is no longer required when mounting standard AWS S3 buckets.
      * Sandboxes can now burst CPU up to 2x their requested allocation when the host has spare capacity, and you can request fractional (sub-core) vCPU down to 0.05.
      * Self-hosted LangSmith installations now show the Sandboxes navigation item and use the instance-level sandbox flag to open the Sandboxes page.
      * Shells and tools inside a sandbox now report the sandbox's name as the hostname instead of a generic default, and the name resolves from within the sandbox.
      * Self-hosted LangSmith installations can open the Sandboxes page without enabling the Deployments frontend.
      * Sandboxes now set common CA-bundle environment variables by default, so Python, Node, Deno, curl, and git tooling automatically trusts the sandbox's egress proxy certificate and no longer fails with TLS certificate-verification errors when its traffic is proxied.

      ## Administration

      * The roles table on the Organization Roles settings page now scrolls correctly when there are more roles than fit on screen.
      * You can now fetch a single workspace directly via `GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}` instead of listing all workspaces and filtering client-side.
      * Organization admins can disable model providers across every workspace from organization settings. Disabled providers are hidden in the playground, evaluators, Fleet, and other model pickers, and workspace admins cannot re-enable them.
      * The email confirmation page now shows only the Confirm account step in the sidebar instead of future onboarding steps you have not reached yet.
      * Self-hosted deployments now apply explicit DEFAULT\_ORG\_FEATURE\_\* and DEFAULT\_FEATURE\_\* environment variables over stored organization and tenant config values, so operators can enable or disable features and limits globally without editing Postgres.
      * The navigation product switcher now shows the configured organization logo alongside the LangSmith or Fleet wordmark instead of repeating the organization logo.
      * Organization admins can now toggle role restriction from the Roles settings page. Restricted roles can only be assigned by users with the workspaces:manage permission.
      * The organization-wide public sharing toggle now lives on the General settings page alongside the other organization settings, replacing its standalone Configuration section.
      * When a user is removed from all mapped SSO groups, the organization and workspace access granted through SSO group sync is revoked on their next sign-in. Access assigned by other means (SCIM, JIT, or manual invitation) is unaffected.
      * Workspace invite batch requests are now rate limited per workspace to reduce bulk invitation abuse. [Learn more](/langsmith/usage-and-billing#workspace-invite-batch-endpoint).
      * LangSmith Home now shows a banner promoting Interrupt, our agent conference in London and NYC this fall, with a link to get tickets.

      ### LLM Gateway

      * The LLM gateway now supports `POST /openai/v1/responses/compact` (and the legacy `/responses/compact`), routing it through the chat-shape responses handler.
      * When a gateway spend-cap policy targets more than one user, workspace, or API key, the create/edit policy form now explains that the limit applies to the combined spend across the selected entities rather than per entity.
      * The LLM gateway now forwards every documented OpenAI API route it does not handle directly (models, files, batches, images, and more) to the upstream provider, so clients can reach the full OpenAI surface through the gateway. Custom OpenAI-compatible providers inherit the same passthrough routes.
      * The LLM Gateway policies page now lets you sort each section by spend limit or usage percentage, and filter down to a specific workspace, user, or API key.
      * LLM gateway data protection redaction now prepends a short disclaimer to redacted message text so models know SAFE\_TO\_USE placeholders are safe to reuse verbatim.
      * The LLM Gateway now proxies Anthropic's Files and Managed Agents endpoints, so you can use them with your gateway-managed workspace key alongside Messages and Models.
      * Creating an LLM Gateway spend or data protection policy now applies to the organization you are signed in to, replacing the organization dropdown with a read-only display of the current organization.
      * Long selected values, like a user's email in the Gateway Policies filter, now truncate with an ellipsis instead of overlapping the dropdown chevron.
      * The LLM Gateway now accepts workspace-scoped LangSmith OAuth bearer tokens across its provider routes, so OAuth clients can invoke configured models without a LangSmith API key.

      ## Other

      * When you add runs to an annotation queue without specifying `extend_trace_retention`, short-lived traces stay on short-lived retention. Pass `extend_trace_retention=true` to upgrade traces to extended retention.
    </Update>

    <Update label="June 29 - July 3, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * Model, prompt, and tool chips in the [Experiments](/langsmith/analyze-an-experiment) table config cells now lay out from real measurements for accurate truncation, and the +N overflow badge is a clickable dropdown whose entries expose the same actions (filter, group by, open in playground, and details) as a chip's own menu.
      * Expanding the run tree for repetition runs in [experiment comparison](/langsmith/compare-experiment-results) views now works reliably when a repetition root has a `project ID` but no `session ID`.
      * [Evaluators](/langsmith/evaluators) linked to Hub prompts now load correctly for flat and playground-shaped prompt commits, fixing crashes when editing existing evaluators.
      * Code evaluator upload now accepts Python entrypoints annotated with PEP 604 union return types (for example `-> dict | None`).
      * `POST /v2/datasets/{dataset_id}/experiment-runs` is the supported public API for paginated experiment comparison. Legacy dataset comparison helpers are removed from the public OpenAPI spec and generated SDKs; existing HTTP routes continue to work for LangSmith UI clients.
      * Each example's dataset splits now render as chips in the dataset Examples table, laid out from real measurements with a clickable +N overflow menu when an example belongs to more splits than fit the column.
      * The [experiment comparison](/langsmith/compare-experiment-results) view now offers an optional, reorderable "Splits (latest)" column that shows each example's current dataset split assignments as chips, reflecting live membership rather than the as-of-run snapshot.
      * [Evaluators](/langsmith/evaluators) spend charts on project and dataset evaluator tabs keep their desktop layout on narrow screens and scroll horizontally instead of compressing the chart and stat cards.
      * The [experiment comparison](/langsmith/compare-experiment-results) and group-by views now show each example's current dataset split rather than the split it had when the experiment ran, so you can tell whether failures already belong to a split without re-running the experiment.
      * LangSmith now caps reusable [evaluators](/langsmith/evaluators) per workspace to prevent unbounded resource growth. Contact support if your workspace needs a higher limit.
      * Creating [dataset examples](/langsmith/manage-datasets) from [source runs](/langsmith/manage-datasets) now correctly fetches run inputs and outputs backed by SmithDB, and no longer fails the whole request if one of several source runs cannot be found.
      * Custom code evaluators that time out or fail on a run now record an error on that run instead of silently leaving it without feedback, so partial evaluation failures are visible on the experiment.
      * The Open source run action on an example page now reads session and start time from dedicated example fields populated at creation, enabling reliable navigation to the source trace on SmithDB.

      ### Tracing

      * LangSmith now enforces user-defined monthly trace limits scoped to individual projects and users. New traces that exceed a configured limit are rejected, while patches and feedback for already-accepted traces continue to flow through.
      * The tracing and evaluation onboarding quickstarts now show the correct `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` for bring-your-own-cloud data plane workspaces instead of the shared multi-tenant endpoint.
      * Sharing, viewing, or unsharing any run in a trace now operates on the trace root, so every run in a shared trace is publicly viewable, and public run links open the selected run within the shared trace.
      * Projects with existing traces no longer incorrectly display the onboarding screen when filtered or scoped to a time window with no recent runs. The project run-count check now looks back 30 days instead of the previous one-hour window.
      * Bulk export compression now defaults to zstandard (zstd) for improved performance. Self-hosted environments retain the gzip default via the `FF_BULK_EXPORT_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION` environment variable.
      * LangSmith now returns clearer 409 Conflict messages when duplicate run create or update payloads are submitted. The message indicates whether the duplicate was a run create or run update request when possible.
      * LangSmith [MCP tools](/langsmith/langsmith-mcp-server) that fetch runs or thread history now accept `project UUIDs` in addition to project names, making trace URL investigations faster and less error-prone.
      * OpenTelemetry resource attributes (set via `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`) now appear on traces as metadata namespaced under otel.resource.\*, so you can attach details like user IDs without changing how your tracer emits spans.
      * Vercel AI SDK traces sent over raw OpenTelemetry now render in the Messages view. Previously these traces showed an empty Messages tab because no format adapter claimed them.
      * Thread stats requests that opt into streaming now return the main stats first and add feedback stats when they are ready.
      * When a runs query times out, the runs table now shows a timeout banner for better responsiveness.
      * LangSmith now preserves traces in multipart ingestion batches when one run has oversized inputs or outputs. Oversized input and output fields are replaced with a placeholder instead of rejecting the entire batch.

      ### Engine

      * When an Engine project reaches its monthly spend limit, the Next Run status chip and project spend card now show a clear "Monthly spend limit reached" state with a button that takes you straight to raising the limit.
      * LangSmith exposes Engine issue listing and retrieval through hosted [MCP tools](/langsmith/langsmith-mcp-server) and generated SDK methods. Agents and API clients can fetch issue details directly by `issue ID` or filter issues by project, status, severity, tag, and update time.
      * A new Engine board callout points you to the trace-scope setting, where you can restrict Engine's reviews to runs matching a run name or metadata value.

      ### Prompts and playground

      * Self-hosted [Playground](/langsmith/playground-model-providers) and evaluator outbound model calls now honor proxy environment variables while preserving SSRF validation on every request.
      * When you save a prompt to an application from the playground, LangSmith keeps the workspace application filter on All Applications instead of switching the rest of the UI to that application.
      * Typing a workspace member's name or email in the [Context Hub](/langsmith/prompt-context-hub#context-hub) search box now also returns the prompts and resources they created.
      * The playground now includes Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Fable 5, and Claude Opus 4.8 in the Anthropic, Bedrock, and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform model selectors. New Anthropic playground sessions default to Claude Sonnet 5.

      ### Feedback

      * Editing the score on evaluator-generated feedback (for example from the experiment comparison view) now saves correctly instead of failing with "Failed to add feedback correction".
      * Adding feedback or reviewer notes from the LangSmith UI no longer upgrades short-lived traces to extended retention. Long-lived traces are unchanged.
      * Feedback statistics queries now route through the official ClickHouse client, resolving query failures and improving compatibility with ClickHouse 25.x.

      ### Monitoring and alerting

      * Alert chart previews now handle relative date ranges consistently, preventing failures when loading 14-day or 30-day previews.
      * [Dashboards](/langsmith/dashboards) chart tooltips and axes now show up to eight fractional digits (previously two), so very small costs and rates no longer round down to zero.
      * Time-series charts on custom dashboards now leave gaps for missing data points instead of plotting them as zero, and lines connect across those gaps so trends remain readable.

      ### Automations

      * Applying a prebuilt evaluator without a filter now defaults to running on root runs only, matching manually created evaluators. Previously it ran on every nested run in a trace.
      * Turning an online evaluator or automation on or off now saves for any role that can edit rules, instead of silently reverting for members without the retention-configuration permission.

      ## Deployment

      * Self-hosted deployments can now request CPU and memory above the previous Cloud limits of 8/16 cores and 32/16 GB, bounded only by your cluster capacity. Lower bounds, multiple-of-128 granularity, and Redis memory ordering are still enforced.
      * Custom Slack app triggers can now opt in to let third-party bots trigger an agent. Enable the allow bot triggers toggle on a registration to accept events from external bots; echoes from your own and other LangSmith-registered bots are still dropped to prevent loops.
      * Agents now skip unreachable or misconfigured non-default MCP servers immediately instead of retrying them, removing a slow round-trip from the tool-loading step and cutting time-to-first-token.
      * Standby (uptime) minutes for LangGraph Platform deployments could be billed more than once when replicas reported overlapping intervals across separate usage-reporting runs. Reporting now deduplicates each minute across runs so it is billed at most once.

      ## Sandboxes

      * Sandbox command output is now re-chunked into bounded single WebSocket frames, so clients that do not reassemble continuation frames (including the Go SDK) can read large streamed or replayed output without truncated JSON.
      * S3 sandbox mounts now default `endpoint_url` to [https://s3.amazonaws.com](https://s3.amazonaws.com) when it is not provided, so the field is no longer required when mounting standard AWS S3 buckets.
      * [Sandboxes](/langsmith/sandboxes) can now burst CPU up to 2x their requested allocation when the host has spare capacity, and you can request fractional (sub-core) vCPU down to 0.05.
      * When creating a sandbox, you can now configure Git, S3, and GCS filesystem mounts, including mount paths, Git remotes, bucket settings, and cache options. Configured mounts appear in the sandbox table and detail view.
      * The LangSmith SDKs now support creating, listing, updating, and deleting sandbox registries for pulling private container images, alongside the existing sandbox and snapshot operations.
      * Sandbox snapshot builds can now request an XFS root filesystem for sandbox-host based environments.
      * Sandbox creation no longer fails intermittently with "sandbox not ready" errors when an underlying host is disrupted. Affected capacity now retries the contended resource lock and recovers automatically instead of leaving the pool degraded.
      * Sandbox host startup now validates the full version directory before reuse, so a missing initrd no longer causes create-time failures after a partial or stale install.
      * Creating a sandbox snapshot from a Docker image now records the image's tag (e.g. ubuntu:24.04 becomes the 24.04 tag), and creating a sandbox from a snapshot name without a tag resolves the latest tag, mirroring Docker.
      * Self-hosted LangSmith installations now show the [Sandboxes](/langsmith/sandboxes) navigation item and use the instance-level sandbox flag to open the Sandboxes page.

      ## Administration

      * A new Project and user limits tab on the enterprise Usage configuration page lets you set monthly trace-count limits scoped to a specific project or user. Add, edit, and delete limits from the page.
      * Anonymous organizations now show an "Anonymity mode is on" banner on the members page, and the usage breakdown hides the group-by-user option for non-internal viewers.
      * New API keys now default to a finite expiration date instead of requiring a custom value. When an organization enforces a shorter maximum, the form defaults to that maximum instead.
      * You can now fetch a single workspace directly via GET /api/v1/workspaces/ instead of listing all workspaces and filtering client-side.
      * Org and workspace admins can now edit the role of a pending member invite directly from the Members settings page, without needing to cancel and re-send the invite.
      * The Usage limits page now shows each workspace's configured total and extended (long-lived) trace limits, including caps that were previously hidden while the spend limit displayed "Unlimited".
      * The batch workspace invite endpoint no longer returns a 409 error when inviting users who are already pending org invitees or active org members. Those users are added directly to the workspace without requiring a new org invite.
      * The role selector in the edit pending member invite dialog now uses a scrollable select, matching the invite flow. This ensures all custom roles are accessible when many workspace roles are defined.
      * Self-hosted deployments can now encode spaces in the OIDC authorization request as %20 instead of +, so single sign-on works with identity providers that reject the default + encoding of the scope list. Enable it by setting OAUTH\_URL\_ENCODE\_SCOPE\_SPACES=true.
      * Billing upgrade dialogs now stay within the viewport and scroll when payment or business details make the form taller than the screen.
      * Non-admin callers with manage-members permission can no longer assign restricted roles to workspace members or invite users with restricted roles to the workspace.
      * Filter the organization's service keys and personal access tokens by workspace on the API keys settings page.
      * Users without workspaces:manage permission cannot use restricted roles for invites, role changes, or user deletions in the UI.
      * Adding existing active or pending organization members to a workspace no longer fails when organization-level invites are disabled. Disabled org invites continue to block new organization invitees.
      * The Roles settings page now scrolls correctly when an organization has more roles than fit on screen.
      * Organization admins can once again edit the role of and remove other organization admins from the Organization Members settings page. Organization Operators, who share the same admin-level permissions but should not manage other admins, are now correctly prevented from editing, removing, or promoting members to Organization Admin.

      ### LLM Gateway

      * LLM gateway data protection policies can now configure whether a guard pipeline timeout allows the request through or blocks it. Existing policies default to allowing requests on timeout.
      * The LLM gateway now supports POST /openai/v1/responses/compact (and the legacy /responses/compact), routing it through the chat-shape responses handler.
      * Guard policies now let you choose which PII rule categories to detect, with separate faster rule-based and slower model-based detection options, instead of a single on/off PII toggle.
      * Gateway guard secret redaction now detects additional token formats, including SendGrid API tokens, Google OAuth access tokens, JWTs, Slack webhook URLs, and legacy LangSmith keys.
      * The [LLM Gateway](/langsmith/llm-gateway) policies page now lets you sort each section by spend limit or usage percentage, and filter down to a specific workspace, user, or API key.
    </Update>

    <Update label="June 15-19, 2026">
      ## Observability and evaluations

      ### Automations

      * [Automations](/langsmith/rules) now let you control trace retention per action, so traces matched by a rule can stay at base retention instead of being upgraded.

      ### Engine

      * The [Engine](/langsmith/engine) issue board now shows a Connect GitHub action when GitHub is not connected, so you can set up pull request creation without leaving the board.
      * [Engine](/langsmith/engine) now has a unified enablement screen with access requests, and organization settings consolidate Engine usage and limits in one place.
      * Organization admins now receive [Engine](/langsmith/engine) spend emails when spend crosses each configured threshold, and pausing or disabling Engine now asks for confirmation.

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * [Experiments](/langsmith/analyze-an-experiment) now show live loading progress in the header and the Progress column, so you can track completed and evaluated runs in real time.
      * [Evaluators](/langsmith/evaluators) now include a trace-retention toggle in the advanced options, so scored traces can stay at base retention when that fits your workflow.
      * [Evaluator](/langsmith/evaluators) prompt editing now offers an advanced mode for editing Mustache templates directly with separate variable mappings.
      * You can now apply resource tags when creating a [dataset](/langsmith/manage-datasets), including from scratch, file upload, or a clone.
      * Auto-attached Assertions [evaluators](/langsmith/evaluators) now read assertions from the reference output, so experiment scores reflect actual pass and fail results.

      ### Prompts and playground

      * [OAuth client credentials](/langsmith/model-configurations#oauth-client-credentials) now support per-workspace setup on model configurations, so workspace admins can self-serve OAuth on saved prompts and models.
      * The [Playground](/langsmith/playground-model-providers) now exposes a Reasoning Summary option for OpenAI reasoning models on the Responses API.
      * The model dropdown no longer suggests OpenAI models for an OpenAI Compatible Endpoint, so you can enter your own [custom model name](/langsmith/model-configurations).

      ### Tracing

      * [Trace query syntax](/langsmith/trace-query-syntax) now has a full operator reference, field table, and quick examples, so API filtering is easier to discover.
      * The [OpenTelemetry guide](/langsmith/trace-with-opentelemetry) now explains how to link spans to an existing LangSmith SDK trace and what happens when a parent span never arrives, so cross-process traces are easier to debug.

      ### Monitoring and alerting

      * [Dashboards](/langsmith/dashboards) now include a chart builder with chart templates, a create and edit pane, and brush and series controls on time series charts.
      * You can now send [alerts](/langsmith/alerts) to Slack as a native notification target and connect or disconnect the Slack app from the UI.

      ## Deployment

      * Preview [deployments](/langsmith/deployment) now build the image for the preview commit instead of reusing the parent deployment's image.

      ## Sandboxes

      * [Sandbox auth proxy](/langsmith/sandbox-auth-proxy) now documents GCP rules and service-account handling, so Google API access through the proxy is clearer.
      * [Sandboxes](/langsmith/sandboxes) now marks AWS US SaaS availability as generally available, so the region table reflects the current rollout.
      * [Sandboxes](/langsmith/sandboxes) now support Git mounts and Google Cloud Storage bucket mounts.

      ## Admin and billing

      ### Administration

      * [Organization settings](/langsmith/administration-overview) now clarify that SSO/SCIM group names can omit spaces, so enterprise IdPs that disallow spaces still work cleanly.
      * The Vanta MCP integration is now generally available to all workspaces.
      * Applying tags when creating datasets, prompts, and projects is now governed by dedicated [tag-on-create permissions](/langsmith/administration-overview).

      ### Engine

      * [Engine](/langsmith/engine) now shows only project-level spend in project view, so org-wide spend stays in the org settings surface.
      * [Engine](/langsmith/engine) now keeps the Slack issue-alert deck pinned above the scrolling issues list, so the callout stays visible as you browse.

      ### Datasets and experiments

      The experiments table now displays loading progress bars showing the number of runs completed and evaluated, and experiments that predate this feature show a placeholder progress bar.

      * [Dashboards](/langsmith/dashboards) now support time series bar and line charts backed by the v2 chart API, so monitored metrics can use the newer chart type.
      * Categorical feedback now shows derived percentages in experiment tables, so pass/fail metrics are easier to scan.

      ### Prompts and playground

      ### Insights

      * The [Insights Agent](/langsmith/insights) now supports scheduled reports on daily, weekly, or custom cron intervals, so report generation runs without manual triggering. Time ranges compute dynamically, so a "last 24 hours" report always reflects the most recent window when it runs, not when you configured it.

      ### Datasets and experiments

      * You can now pin any experiment as a baseline. The pinned experiment stays at the top of the [Experiments](/langsmith/compare-experiment-results) view and serves as the automatic comparison point for later runs, surfacing performance deltas across every column so improvements and regressions are immediately clear.

      ### Annotation and human feedback

      * New pairwise [annotation queues](/langsmith/annotation-queues) let reviewers compare two runs side by side and choose whether option A is better, option B is better, or the two are equal across rubric items. LangSmith automatically pairs runs between two experiments and manages queues, reviewer assignments, and trace access, so you can run A/B evaluations across agents, prompts, and models, including for subjective dimensions like tone, correctness, usefulness, or style.

      * Schedule cards explain when weekly spend or monthly agent usage limits automatically pause a schedule. Other system pauses also appear on the affected schedule.
      * Kimi K2.6 is no longer offered when choosing a model for a Fleet agent. Agents already using it keep working, and workspaces with Kimi K2.6 as their default model start new agents on GPT-5.4 Mini instead.
      * The agent hover card shows **Delete** only when you have permission to delete that agent.

      * Fleet agents send Slack replies as standard Markdown, so tables, headers, and task lists render as native Slack content instead of code blocks.
      * The beta Fleet feedback API requires both `thread_id` and `run_id` when submitting a rating, so ratings stay attached to the selected reply.
      * `GET /v1/fleet/feedback` lets workspace admins list any user's ratings during beta. It returns up to 100 recent feedback records, with an `is_truncated` flag when older records are excluded.
      * Setting or clearing a rating through `POST` and `DELETE /v1/fleet/feedback` records a workspace audit log entry, including the rating ID.

      * New managed Fleet sandboxes inherit the platform retention policy when you omit delete\_after\_stop\_seconds. Explicit zero and positive values remain unchanged.
      * Threads that stop for an approval or a question now receive their title while they wait, so scheduled runs no longer sit in the inbox untitled until someone opens them. The inbox shows the title loading indicator only while a title is actually on its way.
      * Opening a workspace skill just added to an agent in Fleet no longer shows an empty modal before the agent is saved. The skill detail now opens with its full file tree, the Add to agent button waits for the skill's files to load, and a failed load can be retried.
      * Agent owners can trigger a workspace webhook against an agent again from the Configure panel's Advanced settings. The rows were missing since the Configure panel replaced the standalone agent editor, and each run packages the agent's saved files rather than unsaved edits.
      * Fleet provisions sandboxes correctly when you start a new conversation or retry interrupted sandbox creation.
      * Fleet background runs reconnect to the agent's existing sandbox using its saved name. Older UUID-named sandboxes continue to work, and files persist across chats and sandbox restarts.
      * Fleet now creates an empty /workspace when it provisions a sandbox, so the files API and file browsers list it right away instead of returning 404 until the agent's first run.
      * Fleet preserves Amazon Bedrock reasoning metadata when you abandon a pending interrupt, preventing unsupported content block errors on the next turn.

      * Fleet agent responses now include the server-generated slug for addressing agent-scoped sandboxes through the sandbox API.
      * Fleet clients can activate the sandbox referenced by a thread and receive its ready status in the response.
      * Fleet agents now support saved Databricks model configurations, using your configured workspace URL, serving endpoint, and workspace credentials. You can connect through Databricks Model Serving or AI Gateway routes.
      * Self-hosted deployments can now forward a REST caller's `X-Fleet-Forward-*` headers to the custom MCP servers an agent calls, so a policy gateway in front of those servers can see per-invocation context such as an end-user identity. Off by default; enable with `FLEET_MCP_FORWARD_CALLER_HEADERS=true`. Values are asserted by the caller and are not verified by LangSmith.

      * Outlook tools can send emails or create drafts with files from the agent workspace, including StateBackend and sandbox-backed agents.
      * Saved schedules now display a text Active or Paused badge alongside the icon, making a schedule's state clearer and more accessible.
      * Claude Sonnet 5 is now available as a directly selectable Anthropic model in Fleet and Agent Builder, with adaptive thinking enabled.
      * GET /v1/fleet/users lists and searches the members of your workspace by email or name, returning the user ID that agent sharing takes. API-only Fleet clients no longer need a user ID from elsewhere before sharing an agent.
      * Managed Deep Agent channel setup now accepts LangSmith API keys and bearer tokens while enforcing workspace secret and deployment permissions before provisioning.
      * Deployments can now have the general-purpose agent build a new agent directly in the chat, writing its name, description, tools, triggers, and instructions, instead of showing a Create agent button that hands setup to the new agent. Set FLEET\_INLINE\_AGENT\_GENERATION on the Fleet API server, the Fleet queue, and the platform backend to turn it on. Off by default.
      * POST /v1/fleet/sandboxes creates a sandbox from a snapshot and returns it ready to use, so a headless client on external OIDC can provision one without reaching for the platform sandboxes API. Choose the boot image with snapshot\_id or a name:tag reference, or omit both for the workspace default.
      * DELETE /v1/fleet/sandboxes/ removes one sandbox, so a headless client on external OIDC can clean up a sandbox without reaching for the platform sandboxes API. It is idempotent; deleting a sandbox that is already gone still returns 204; and the sandbox is torn down in the background, so a read taken right after shows it in a deleting state rather than absent.
      * GET /v1/fleet/sandboxes//files/content returns the raw bytes of a file in a sandbox. Byte ranges are supported via the Range header, and HEAD reports a file's size without transferring it.
      * POST /v1/fleet/sandboxes//files writes a file into a sandbox from a multipart/form-data body, completing the Fleet file API alongside the existing list and read endpoints. The path query parameter names the destination on its own, so the upload no longer depends on reaching a sandbox's dataplane URL directly. Files are streamed rather than buffered, and files larger than 100 megabytes are refused with 413.
      * GET /v1/fleet/sandboxes//files returns the files under a path in a sandbox, matched by a glob pattern and paged with page\_size and an opaque cursor. Paging replaces the silent result cap the sandbox glob applied, so a large directory can be read in full instead of stopping partway.
      * DELETE /v1/fleet/sandbox-snapshots/ removes a sandbox snapshot, which pairs with snapshot creation for the delete-then-recreate retry after a failed build. It is idempotent, and returns 409 while any sandbox is still booted from the snapshot, including a stopped one.
      * GET /v1/fleet/sandbox-snapshots/ returns one sandbox snapshot, so a client can watch a snapshot's build status without re-reading the whole list. The path parameter accepts a snapshot id or a Docker-style reference, where a bare name means name:latest.
      * Fleet usage charts now display spend, tool, and model data instead of appearing blank.
      * GET /v1/fleet/users now works for Fleet deployments authenticating through an external OIDC provider, not only for API-key callers. Headless clients on OIDC can resolve a colleague's user ID for agent sharing.
      * Self-hosted Fleet can attach access profiles whose callback URLs use Kubernetes-internal service names when the deployment enables internal Kubernetes destinations.

    <Update label="August 10-17, 2026">
      ## Fleet

      * Models in Fleet usage reports now sort correctly by cost, including models with no recorded cost.
      * Read-only agents now keep the Configure entry point available after the panel is closed, so users can return to agent details and cloning.
      * The Teams reply to channel tool now asks for approval by default, matching the other Teams write tools. Agents that already set this tool to run automatically keep their current behavior, and you can switch it back to Auto per agent.
      * Agent Builder now shows actionable workspace-secret loading failures with retry guidance while preserving existing missing-key prompts.
      * Fleet agents can browse their OneDrive files, download and update documents, upload files, rename files, and create sharing links.
      * Fleet agents can list direct Outlook attachments and discover linked OneDrive or SharePoint files in message bodies.
      * Fleet agents can forward an email to new recipients with an optional comment, and move a message into another folder. Both ask for approval first.
      * Fleet agents can list a mailbox's folders, including nested ones, and scope an email search to a single folder instead of the whole mailbox.
      * Deleting an agent completes cleanly and removes the agent's files along with it. Previously the delete could return a permission error after the agent had already disappeared from the agent list.
      * Fleet can now load agent Prompt Hub directories up to 25 MiB, allowing agents with larger memory and file trees to remain accessible.
      * Self-hosted deployments can set `FLEET_SCHEDULES_ENABLED=false` to disable recurring runs, unbind the schedule tools, and remove scheduling prompts from agents.
      * Runs started through the Fleet API are attributed to the user whose credential invoked them, instead of grouping together under a blank user in the usage breakdown.
      * OneDrive tools now return exact drive-relative item paths and reuse them for downloads and updates. This reduces file-not-found errors caused by opaque item references.
      * Fleet validates Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files before uploading them to OneDrive or SharePoint, and automatically repairs valid base64-encoded Office files so they upload without corruption.
      * Fleet skill get, create, and update operations now resolve external OIDC users correctly while preserving workspace permissions.
    </Update>

    <Update label="August 3-10, 2026">
      ## Fleet

      * Connecting Google now grants Fleet agents access to your own Docs, Sheets, and Slides, not only files the agent created itself. Existing connections keep working unchanged; reconnect Google from the Integrations page to grant the wider access.
      * You can now attach .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx files in chat without giving the agent a sandbox. Models that accept document input, such as OpenAI and Gemini, read the file directly.
      * Sandbox-backed Fleet agents now treat PPT requests as PowerPoint deliverables and create .pptx files instead of HTML presentations.
      * Sandbox-backed Fleet agents can create spreadsheets, revise existing workbooks, and answer questions about .xlsx and .xlsm files without installing spreadsheet tooling first. A built-in skill guides safe openpyxl usage and validates each workbook before delivery.
      * While an agent works on a turn, the chat now shows a live elapsed-time count that appears after a couple of seconds and picks up a rotating status label on longer waits, so a slow turn reads as in progress rather than stalled. Models that stream reasoning still collapse to the time they spent thinking once the answer arrives.
      * Fleet agents can now work with Google Drive, searching, organizing, sharing, and inspecting files, and gain additional Sheets, Slides, Docs, Calendar, Gmail, and Meet actions such as replying to and forwarding email, responding to invitations, and checking free/busy times.
      * Fleet now uses the selected user identity for GitHub requests that are not tied to a specific repository.
      * Custom Slack apps can optionally subscribe to all new channel messages instead of only @mentions. When enabled, the agent receives each message and replies only when helpful.
      * Fleet now displays selected artifact elements as feedback chips while messages are queued during an active run.
      * Sandbox-backed Fleet agents can convert legacy Office, OpenDocument, RTF, EPUB, and text-based PDF files to Markdown for reading and extraction. A built-in skill guides modern Office files and directly supported PDFs to their existing workflows.
      * When an agent reads a file its model cannot accept as an attachment, Fleet now substitutes a short explanation instead of failing the request. Conversations that previously became stuck recover on their next message.
      * Create a Fleet skill from a local folder while preserving its SKILL.md and supporting files.
      * Skill folder uploads now accept up to 500 files, matching what the API supports, and report progress while reading. Folders that are too large or contain non-text files are rejected up front with the specific files named.
    </Update>

    <Update label="July 27-31, 2026">
      ## Fleet

      * Fleet agents can use a built-in configuration-hardening skill to selectively separate trust boundaries, minimize tools, require approval for sensitive actions, and review access.
      * Open chat files in an edge-to-edge workspace, then collapse them back to the Files side panel without losing your place.
      * Self-hosted Fleet agents can use sandbox-backed computer access without requiring a cloud billing plan tier.
      * Files attached to Slack messages are now available under /workspace/uploads for sandbox-backed agents, matching files uploaded from Fleet.
      * Clicking + New Agent from Workspace Agents now opens the same New agent dialog used elsewhere in Fleet, instead of the old draft editor.
      * Navigating to agent chat with an agent selected no longer crashes while the agent details are still loading. The chat shows a loading state until the agent is ready, then renders normally.
      * Sandbox-backed Fleet agents can create or revise downloadable DOCX files without installing an authoring package during the task. A built-in skill guides document authoring and structural validation.
      * The Configure panel is now enabled for everyone, so it always shows up beside the chat when you open an agent.
      * Fleet now resolves AWS IAM roles only for Bedrock models, so loading OpenAI and other provider secrets no longer waits on AWS STS.
      * The new agent creation experience is now enabled for everyone. Asking the assistant for an agent surfaces the Create agent button, and the new agent runs its own setup conversation instead of being built inline.
      * A conversation whose stored state grew past the API's usual single-response size limit now loads in full, up to 32 MiB, instead of failing. The response marks the conversation as oversized, and updates to it still fail until its state shrinks.
      * Sandbox-backed Fleet agents can build a new deck, revise an existing one, and answer questions about the contents of a .pptx file without installing presentation tooling first. A built-in skill guides authoring and validates the file before delivery.
      * Fleet agents can send workspace files to Slack channels, threads, and direct messages using slack\_send\_file and slack\_send\_file\_to\_user.
      * Fleet agents now correctly route sandbox creation and org config requests to the Go platform-backend service on self-hosted deployments where the Go and Python services run on separate addresses, eliminating the need for a reverse-proxy workaround.
    </Update>

    <Update label="July 20-24, 2026">
      ## Fleet

      * Reopening or reloading an agent chat thread while a run is still in progress no longer crashes the chat view. The chat shows a loading state until the agent is ready, then resumes streaming the active run.
      * The Fleet usage dashboard now shows a meter for orgs with a monthly LangChain Unit (LCU) spend limit, comparing month-to-date consumption against the limit and any overage.
      * Arcade MCP gateways configured with Arcade Headers (API-key) authentication can no longer be added to a Fleet workspace, because LangSmith connects to Arcade gateways over OAuth. These gateways now explain how to reconfigure them with Arcade Auth or a User Source instead of failing when you try to connect.
      * Fleet now labels the agent card action as Configure, matching the action in the chat view.
      * When a Google Docs, Sheets, Drive, or Slides tool can't open a file (a 403 or 404), the agent now explains it can only access files it created itself with its connected Google account, instead of wrongly saying the file doesn't exist.
      * Fleet now shows a warning (inline above the failing tool call in chat, and as a message in Slack) when a Google Docs, Sheets, Drive, or Slides tool hits a 403 or 404, explaining the agent can only access files it created itself with its connected Google account.
      * Fleet's configure panel now shows the connection format selector so you can choose whether an agent uses shared or per-user accounts.
      * Agents connected to Slack can now send a file from their workspace into a Slack channel using the new slack\_send\_file tool, for example a report, export, or chart the agent has generated. The file is uploaded server-side and the agent never sees the Slack token.
      * Fleet agents retain DeltaChannel conversation history when thread state is updated, including when users continue trigger-started conversations in chat.
      * Fleet thread APIs can now include the current agent's ID and name, making thread lists and details easier to display without fetching full agent records.
      * Fleet agents with Slack file tools can now send files from thread-scoped and agent-scoped sandbox workspaces.
    </Update>

    <Update label="July 13-17, 2026">
      ## Fleet

      * You can now add any agent to [Slack](/langsmith/fleet/slack-app) in one click. After you authenticate with Slack once, Fleet automatically creates a Slack app configured with the agent's name, description, and icon, and maps each agent to a single Slack app.
      * When an agent is first added to a Slack workspace, it sends the creator a direct message with tips for inviting it to channels and mentioning it.
      * Agents now raise tool approvals directly in [Slack](/langsmith/fleet/slack-app), with Approve and Deny buttons in the thread, so you no longer need to switch to the Fleet UI to respond.
      * When an agent encounters an error during a run, it now replies in the Slack thread instead of going silent. Authentication errors and some other error types include more detail.
      * Agents can now read file attachments in [Slack](/langsmith/fleet/slack-app) messages.
      * The agent editor is now a sidebar built into the agent chat page, which organizes configuration into Channels, Connections, Knowledge, Schedule, and Advanced settings drawers.
      * The agent creation experience now starts from a blank-slate agent that configures itself and pauses at key points to bring you into the process.
      * The load previous conversations tool now writes conversation files into the attached Computer sandbox when one is enabled, so agents can inspect the downloaded history with their normal file tools.
      * Creating a new agent no longer fails with a contentBlocks.push error when the chat stream returns string message content.
      * Reloading an agent chat page no longer flashes the thread list through loading and loaded states multiple times. The sidebar now waits for agent scope to finish loading before fetching threads, so the list settles once.
      * Fleet agents now discover tools with find\_tools or an /tools listing before opening a tool's reference doc, so they no longer waste a turn reading guessed tool filenames that do not exist.
      * The Fleet Fast model tier (`gpt-5.4-mini`) now runs at medium reasoning effort instead of low, improving response quality on harder tasks.
      * The [templates](/langsmith/fleet/templates) gallery now features the Executive Assistant and Software Engineer templates as large cards with a hero illustration, each showing the agent's own icon.
      * Each tool inside a connection in the agent Configure panel now has a remove action (a trash button revealed on hover, matching the connection remove) instead of an on/off switch. The switch implied a reversible toggle, but turning a tool off actually removed it from the agent, so the control now reflects what it does.
      * Sending a chat message while clarifying questions were pending could fail the run and leave the thread stuck. Free-text now correctly dismisses the pending request before continuing.
      * In the Agent Builder chat, the Skills block's "Add skill" menu now opens the browse-workspace, create-skill, and import-from-URL dialogs. Previously choosing an option changed the URL but nothing appeared.
      * Opening an agent in Fleet now always starts a new chat instead of jumping into a recent thread. Past conversations remain available in the thread sidebar.
      * When an agent created from a template introduces itself, it writes what it learns straight to its own memory instead of pausing for approval on every file. Memory writes in your other threads still ask first.
      * Skill descriptions containing quotes, colons, or multiple lines are now parsed and stored correctly, and importing or editing a skill preserves all of its frontmatter instead of dropping fields like license or allowed-tools.
      * The Add connection dialog now groups Arcade MCP servers under a dedicated Arcade section, so they are easy to find instead of being listed under Other.
      * The Fleet model picker now groups served, LCU-billed models (Fast, Pro, Max) separately from bring-your-own models billed per run, making the pricing model for each option clearer.
      * The compact Fast/Pro/Max model picker in Agent Builder now shows the model icon on its closed trigger, matching the full model picker.
      * When an organization reaches its monthly Fleet usage limit, the error now directs users to upgrade their plan to continue.

      ## Fleet

      * In the Agent Builder view, the footer workspace and tenant list is sourced from the Fleet API so you can switch between your Fleet workspaces.
      * The Access Profiles dialog in chat now includes a Create an access profile link that opens the sandboxes create flow, so you can add a profile when a workspace has none configured instead of hitting a dead end.
      * Fleet now completes OAuth for MCP servers whose authorization server requires client-secret authentication at the token endpoint, so connecting these servers no longer fails after the consent step.
      * Creating an agent from a Fleet template now skips the setup wizard and opens the agent editor with the template onboarding card.
      * Fleet now sends the MCP protocol version a server negotiates during the handshake, both when loading tools and when the agent calls them, so MCP servers that require a newer version no longer return zero tools or fail tool calls.
      * Fleet agents can now read files shared with them in Slack. Attach an image, PDF, audio, video, or text file in a mention or DM and the agent ingests it into the conversation.
      * On the Agent Builder Integrations page, searching now selects the All tab so results span every category, and switching category tabs clears the search.
      * When registering an integration OAuth provider for headless connections, `http://` redirect URIs are now accepted only for the loopback IP literals `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`. The localhost hostname is no longer accepted over `http`; use the loopback IP literal or `https`.
      * The [MCP servers settings page](/langsmith/fleet/remote-mcp-servers) now scrolls when the pointer is over the servers list.
      * The Executive Assistant template can now deliver its daily brief and answer @mentions in Slack after you connect a Slack workspace, and both the Executive Assistant and Software Engineer templates received configuration fixes.
      * You can now type and send a message in agent chat while a human-in-the-loop prompt is pending. Sending a new message dismisses the pending request and continues the conversation instead of leaving the composer locked.
      * Empty sections in the agent configuration panel (Channels, Connections, Skills, Schedules, Instructions, and Subagents) now explain what each one is for and what you can add before you connect anything.
      * Opening an agent in the chat inbox no longer issues repeated duplicate background requests while choosing which thread to open, reducing flicker.
      * Fleet agents now load your workspace's private skills. Previously, in workspaces with fine-grained access controls, an agent could start with only public skills available.
      * GitHub App installations now sync through the authenticated LangSmith session after installation completes, keeping workspace linking aligned with the active user.
      * OAuth providers now accept an optional default redirect URI (`default_redirect_uri`). When set, headless OAuth flows for that provider return the authorization code to it instead of the LangSmith callback, without passing a redirect on every request. The value is validated against the provider's allowed redirect URIs.

      ## New features

      * The Access Profiles dialog in chat now includes a Create an [access profile](/langsmith/fleet/computer-use) link that opens the sandboxes create flow, so you can add a profile when a workspace has none configured instead of hitting a dead end.
      * Fleet agents can now delete files from their memory and [skills](/langsmith/fleet/skills) using the new delete tool, including files in linked workspace skills. Core agent files and read-only system skills remain protected.
      * Fleet now completes OAuth for [MCP servers](/langsmith/fleet/remote-mcp-servers) whose authorization server requires client-secret authentication at the token endpoint, so connecting these servers no longer fails after the consent step.
      * First-time Fleet users now see a streamlined welcome modal with two clear paths (describe an agent to build with AI, starting from a prompt in Chat, or start from a curated template), replacing the previous multi-step setup wizard.
      * Creating an agent from a Fleet [template](/langsmith/fleet/templates) now skips the setup wizard and opens the agent editor with the template onboarding card.
      * Fleet now sends the MCP protocol version a server negotiates during the handshake, both when loading tools and when the agent calls them, so [MCP servers](/langsmith/fleet/remote-mcp-servers) that require a newer version no longer return zero tools or fail tool calls.
      * Fleet agents receive the day of week alongside the current date (for example "Monday, June 29th 2026"), so scheduling and date reasoning no longer relies on the model inferring the weekday from the ISO date.
      * File edits in Fleet agent chat now render as syntax-highlighted, line-by-line diffs, making changes easier to review.
      * When you connect a custom Slack bot to a Fleet agent, Fleet sends the installer a direct message with quick setup tips, including how to add the bot to channels and mention it with @.
      * Fleet agents now have a Slack tool for listing channels the connected bot is a member of, making it easier to discover the right channel before posting or reading messages.
      * Fleet OAuth provider and integration responses now include an `owner` field (`workspace` or `platform`) so you can tell your own resources apart from built-in, platform-managed ones. The platform manager organization can now create and modify built-in OAuth providers.
      * Setting up a schedule is now clearer: choose a preset (daily, weekly, monthly, or every few minutes) or enter a custom cron expression, with a live human-readable preview and inline validation as you go.
      * When registering an integration OAuth provider for headless connections, `http://` redirect URIs are now accepted only for the loopback IP literals `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`. The localhost hostname is no longer accepted over http; use the loopback IP literal or https.

      ## Fixes

      * On the Agent Builder [Integrations](/langsmith/fleet/tools) page, searching now selects the All tab so results span every category, and switching category tabs clears the search.
      * When a Fleet agent's subagent calls a tool that requires human approval, the approval prompt now appears in the chat instead of the run completing without it.
    </Update>

      ## New features

      * [Fleet tools](/langsmith/fleet/tools) now include Salesforce OAuth provider setup for self-hosted users, so you can configure the provider end to end.
      * Agent sharing is redesigned around two choices, who can use and who can edit an agent, plus a Publish as template option that lets others fork their own editable copy.
      * Fleet agents now post a notification to the originating thread, such as Slack, when they pause at a human-in-the-loop interrupt, with a link back to the agent chat.
      * You can now complete Fleet integration OAuth through your own callback URL, so headless setups can finish authentication without the LangSmith UI.
      * Agent cards now show the agent owner.
      * New first-party [templates](/langsmith/fleet/templates), Brand Copywriter and Applicant Screening, are available in the gallery.

      ## Fixes

      * Switching threads in the agent chat now clears the previous thread immediately and shows a loading state instead of stale messages.
      * The [skills](/langsmith/fleet/skills) list now degrades gracefully when one skill fails to load, so the remaining skills still appear.

      ## Fixes

      * The Fleet list-threads endpoint now returns `items` instead of `threads`, so the response shape matches the rest of the API.
      * Fleet thread requests now return a clearer error when a large response would have triggered a 5xx, so long lists fail gracefully.
    </Update>

    <Update label="June 1-5, 2026">
      ## New features

      * [Skills](/langsmith/fleet/skills) load faster: the skills list fetches lightweight metadata first and loads file contents only when you open a skill.
      * The agent creation menu adds a [Templates](/langsmith/fleet/templates) entry.
      * The [remote MCP](/langsmith/fleet/remote-mcp-servers) authorization screen now shows the connecting application's name, logo, and homepage, terms, and privacy links instead of its raw `client ID`.
      * [Slack integration](/langsmith/fleet/slack-app) available in AWS and APAC regions.

      ## Fixes

      * [Scheduled (cron) execution](/langsmith/fleet/schedules) is restored for enterprise Fleet agents.
      * Long-running agent runs and agent-builder generations are no longer cut off after 60 seconds.
      * The Gmail read-emails [tool](/langsmith/fleet/tools) now returns results when you search sent mail with an `in:sent` query.
      * Scrolling is improved for long toolbox, skill, and sub-agent lists in the agent editor, and webhook dialogs now scroll within the viewport.
