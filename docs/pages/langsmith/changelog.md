## Observability and evaluations

### Datasets and experiments

- Model, prompt, and tool chips in the Experiments table config cells now lay out from real measurements for accurate truncation, and the +N overflow badge is a clickable dropdown whose entries expose the same actions (filter, group by, open in playground, and details) as a chip's own menu.
- Expanding the run tree for repetition runs in experiment comparison views now works reliably when a repetition root has a project ID but no session ID.
- Evaluators linked to Hub prompts now load correctly for flat and playground-shaped prompt commits, fixing crashes when editing existing evaluators.
- Code evaluator upload now accepts Python entrypoints annotated with PEP 604 union return types (for example `-> dict | None`).
- POST /v2/datasets/{dataset_id}/experiment-runs is the supported public API for paginated experiment comparison. Legacy dataset comparison helpers are removed from the public OpenAPI spec and generated SDKs; existing HTTP routes continue to work for LangSmith UI clients.
- Each example's dataset splits now render as chips in the dataset Examples table, laid out from real measurements with a clickable +N overflow menu when an example belongs to more splits than fit the column.
- Apply Evaluator on existing experiments now reads runs from SmithDB instead of ClickHouse when the SmithDB experiments flag is enabled, as part of the ongoing ClickHouse deprecation.
- Adds `langsmith evaluator create-llm` to define structured LLM-as-judge evaluator rules from a prompt, schema, and model config file, targeting a project or dataset.
- The experiment comparison view now offers an optional, reorderable "Splits (latest)" column that shows each example's current dataset split assignments as chips, reflecting live membership rather than the as-of-run snapshot.
- Evaluator spend charts on project and dataset evaluator tabs keep their desktop layout on narrow screens and scroll horizontally instead of compressing the chart and stat cards.
- The experiment comparison and group-by views now show each example's current dataset split rather than the split it had when the experiment ran, so you can tell whether failures already belong to a split without re-running the experiment.
- Comparison view now loads token and cost stats from SmithDB for root runs, so the stats columns populate again instead of staying blank
- LangSmith now caps reusable evaluators per workspace to prevent unbounded resource growth. Contact support if your workspace needs a higher limit.
- Creating dataset examples from source runs now correctly fetches run inputs and outputs backed by SmithDB, and no longer fails the whole request if one of several source runs can't be found.
- Select multiple rows in an experiment (or select all matching the current filters) and add, replace, or remove their dataset splits in one action, or copy the selected examples to another dataset; instead of editing rows one at a time.
- The /runs/rules/validate endpoint now supports thread evaluators. Pass test_thread_id and session_id to test a multi-turn evaluator against a real conversation before saving.
- Custom code evaluators that time out or fail on a run now record an error on that run instead of silently leaving it without feedback, so partial evaluation failures are visible on the experiment.
- The Open source run action on an example page now reads session and start time from dedicated example fields populated at creation, enabling reliable navigation to the source trace on SmithDB.
- Adhoc experiment evaluation now fetches runs through the v2 runs query API so wide-column storage is handled correctly and queued evaluators complete.
- The thread evaluator config preview now shows the thread message formats the evaluator actually maps, instead of listing every available format.
- Multi-turn evaluators now include a Test action that runs the evaluator against a sample thread before you save the rule.
- Aggregated feedback stats on the experiments page omit the internal {} placeholder for numeric score-only evaluators, so value breakdowns only list real categorical labels.
- The evaluator config now shows a locked "Trace count ≥ 2" filter for managed thread evaluators, making it clear they only run on threads with multiple turns.
- Experiment comparison and individual experiment views now load run rows on self-hosted deployments that authenticate the UI via SSO/OAuth session cookies. Previously these views could show 'No results found' even though metrics and feedback loaded.
- Experiment statistics now refresh promptly for recently run experiments while keeping historical experiment scans bounded.
- The Assertions evaluator added via "Add evaluator" now reads assertions from the reference output like the auto-attached version, so it grades against the real assertions instead of always failing.
- Evaluator spend chart y-axes now abbreviate amounts of $1,000 or more, making high-spend values easier to scan.
- Exporting a dataset comparison view as CSV now returns a clear "file is too large to export" error instead of a generic server error when the export exceeds internal size limits.
- Opening a chip's dropdown menu (e.g. in the experiments and evaluators tables) no longer blocks scrolling the table or page underneath; the content behind the menu scrolls as expected.
- Each split chip in a row's Splits cell is now interactive in the experiment results and comparison views, with an Edit splits action that opens the single-example split picker so you can reassign splits without leaving the table.
- Add RUN items to a single annotation queue with POST /annotation-queues/{queue_id}/items. The server resolves runs via ClickHouse or SmithDB and returns a standards-shaped items envelope; THREAD support follows in a later release.
- The LangSmith CLI now updates existing code evaluator rules in place when `evaluator upload --replace` is used, avoiding a delete-before-create window if the replacement upload fails.
- Split the read datasets into a new download datasets permission.  Enforce this new permission in both the application and in APIs.  The download button is disabled for those users without the download permission. [Learn more](/langsmith/organization-workspace-operations#datasets).
- Public dataset experiment traces open correctly when experiment runs provide their project identifier through the v2 response shape.
- A run rule with a 0 sampling rate processes no runs, but the scheduler still enumerated it every tick. The scheduler query now skips rules with sampling_rate 0 (parity with the is_enabled check), so they are never dispatched.
- Dataset and experiment tables now truncate long input and reference-output text and show detected base64 images as small thumbnails with a delayed larger preview, avoiding oversized hidden DOM content.
- Experiment tables now defer full payload rendering and output diff preparation until those views are requested, improving responsiveness for runs with large agent trajectories.
- Public dataset share links now resolve the sessions list (with stats) from SmithDB when ClickHouse querying is disabled, so shared dataset pages no longer fail to load on SmithDB-only deployments.
- Add conversation threads to a single annotation queue with POST /annotation-queues/{queue_id}/items using item_type THREAD (thread_id + session_id). Mixed RUN and THREAD batches are supported; the server resolves threads via ClickHouse or SmithDB.
- Code evaluators now get more time to run each batch, so evaluators that import heavy libraries like scikit-learn are less likely to time out.
- POST /annotation-queues/{queue_id}/items now accepts at most 100 items per request and returns a clear validation error when the limit is exceeded. Requests at the limit continue to succeed.
- Online evaluator definitions now include an advanced setting to turn evaluator execution tracing on or off. Feedback generation continues to run when tracing is disabled.
- Applying an evaluator to an existing experiment could fail with "Failed to start evaluation" on large experiments. It now starts reliably even when the run count is temporarily unavailable.
- Linked runs load correctly from public dataset shares when LangSmith uses the ClickHouse compatibility path.
- GET /annotation-queues/{id}/items now returns THREAD queue items alongside RUN items, with an optional item_type filter. THREAD list rows expose identity on the item (thread_id/session_id/start_time) and omit nested thread; RUN list still hydrates nested run for now (same omit planned for metadata-only list). Traces and messages load via the v2 threads APIs when reviewing.
- GET /annotation-queues/{id}/runs and related size endpoints exclude THREAD queue rows (run_id is null) so mixed queues no longer return 500. Use GET /items for thread listing.
- Project settings now require a thread idle time of at least two minutes to ensure thread evaluations include all ingested runs.
- Annotation queue item add requests now consistently enforce a 100-item limit for runs and threads. Over-limit errors clearly show the configured limit.
- The annotation queue review UI builds the left-nav list from GET /items membership metadata and loads the selected run's annotate fields via GET /v2/runs/{id}. Nested run payloads are no longer required on the list response.
- GET /annotation-queues/{id}/items returns Postgres membership metadata for RUN and THREAD items without hydrating nested run or thread payloads from ClickHouse or SmithDB. Orphan queue rows remain listed. The include_stats query parameter is removed. Annotate payloads load via get-one / review APIs.
- When you bulk-add runs from a tracing project, its default dataset now appears first in the dataset picker.
- Giving feedback on a thread annotation queue item now correctly records last reviewed time using the queue membership id, so review progress is saved for both runs and threads.
- Annotation queue review lists now label unnamed run rows as `Run <ID>`, matching thread rows and making mixed queues easier to scan.
- Opening the pairwise experiment comparison from a pairwise annotation queue no longer crashes the page when both compared runs come from the same experiment.
- LangSmith exposes annotation queue item endpoints for adding, listing, updating, deleting, counting, positioning, and reviewing run or thread queue items through the public API and SDK generation flow.
- Uploading a .csv or .jsonl dataset now works regardless of the Content-Type the browser reports. Windows browsers label .csv files as an Excel type, which previously caused valid uploads to fail. Uppercase filenames such as DATASET.CSV are also accepted.
- Evaluator lists on a dataset or tracing project now show an evaluator's current name instead of the name it had when it was attached. Feedback keys are unchanged by a rename.
- Metadata columns in the experiment comparison grid, including `example.metadata.<key>`, now render their values instead of staying empty.
- LangSmith marks every legacy endpoint replaced by the SmithDB SDK migration guide as deprecated: the v1 runs query and retrieve endpoints, the v1 run sharing and public-run read endpoints, `POST /api/v1/datasets/{dataset_id}/runs`, and the annotation queue run endpoints. All of them now respond with `Deprecation: true`, a `Sunset` date of January 31, 2027, and a `Link` header pointing at the migration guide and, where a single replacement exists, the successor endpoint. [Learn more](/langsmith/smithdb-sdk-migration).
- Dataset experiment tables can sort by feedback score when SmithDB queries are enabled and ClickHouse queries are disabled.
- Annotation queue item APIs use project_id for the tracing project. Request bodies also accept session_id as an alias.
- Dataset example views restore clear spacing between the example details and tab navigation.
- Pairwise annotation queue runs again include the tracing project id needed to create feedback when ClickHouse query support is disabled.
- Correcting an evaluator score from the experiment results grid now updates the cell and its popover right away instead of requiring a page refresh.
- The Configure Evaluator pane's header and templates navigation again paint the same background as the pane itself in dark mode.
- Dataset and run attachments now resolve relative signed download URLs before previewing, opening, or downloading them in self-hosted deployments.
- Attachment and object downloads now always declare how the browser should handle the response. Files whose type is unrecognized, or that were stored without a type, are delivered as downloads instead of being rendered in the page.
- Creating a dataset from the Datasets or Home empty state now opens the new dataset instead of briefly showing a Page not found screen.
- Dataset JSON schema descriptions are now safely rendered in editor tooltips.
- Creating or validating an example with a `dataset_id` that is not a well-formed UUID now returns a 422 naming the field instead of a 500.
- Listing or counting examples with an unsupported `filter` expression; an unfilterable attribute, or a `has(...)` comparison whose value is not valid JSON; now returns a 422 naming the `filter` parameter instead of a 500.
- Group by metadata and metadata columns are selectable again in the experiment comparison view. [Learn more](/langsmith/analyze-an-experiment#group-results-by-metadata).
- LangSmith now rejects credential-bearing and non-GitHub remote URLs when rendering evaluation commit links.
- Scrolling through large experiment comparison results no longer re-fetches the first page of examples on every lazy-load, cutting redundant network traffic and reducing load time.
- Creating an annotation queue from an experiment (or adding an experiment to an existing queue) now includes all matching runs without failing on large experiments.
- The evaluator spend table keeps the All runs filter badge inactive when an evaluator has no filters.
- Daily evaluator spend, weekly totals, and spend limit monitoring on the Evaluators page now respect the currently selected application, instead of showing data across all applications.
- Adding a traced run to a dataset now copies the run's attachments onto the new example. Attachments were silently dropped on workspaces served by the new runs storage backend; the example was created without them and no error was reported. Attachments passed to online evaluators from those workspaces are fixed the same way.
- The evaluator spend chart once again keeps its evaluator and project/dataset grouping control in the chart header for easier access.
- Dataset example read APIs now include `source_thread_id` when an example is associated with a thread, making thread-created examples easier to trace back to their source.
- Dataset example create APIs now accept and preserve `source_thread_id`, allowing examples created from threads to keep a durable link to their source thread.
- Annotation queue tables now label queue contents as items instead of runs, covering both single-run and pairwise queues.
- Datasets whose input, output, or metadata keys contain a colon can now be exported to CSV. This unblocks datasets built from runs with feedback, where feedback is stored under a `source_run_feedback:<key>` metadata key.
- Managed evaluator configuration no longer shows evaluator tracing controls.
- The Datasets & Experiments table now labels dataset names with a Dataset column header, making the relationship between datasets and experiments clearer.
- Freeform rubric items in an annotation queue now support an optional regex validator. A reviewer's comment that doesn't match the configured pattern is blocked from saving, with an inline error, instead of silently persisting.
- Organization admins can open Tuned Evaluator settings directly from paused evaluator warnings and disabled-toggle tooltips. Other users see guidance to contact an organization admin.
- Annotation queues now support a Data Formatting setting that hides selected JSON paths from a run's Inputs and Outputs while reviewing; pick fields via checkboxes generated from a sample run, or type a path manually. Applies to run items only, not threads.
- Tuned Evaluators are now hidden in BYOC workspaces and self-hosted deployments, where LangChain-managed inference is unavailable.

### Tracing

- The batched-run ingestion log now emits run_verbs as a list of run_id and verbs objects instead of a map keyed by run UUID, preventing structured-log aggregators from exhausting dynamic field limits.
- LangSmith now enforces user-defined monthly trace limits scoped to individual projects and users. New traces that exceed a configured limit are rejected, while patches and feedback for already-accepted traces continue to flow through.
- The tracing and evaluation onboarding quickstarts now show the correct LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT for bring-your-own-cloud data plane workspaces instead of the shared multi-tenant endpoint.
- Sharing, viewing, or unsharing any run in a trace now operates on the trace root, so every run in a shared trace is publicly viewable, and public run links open the selected run within the shared trace.
- Projects with existing traces no longer incorrectly display the onboarding screen when filtered or scoped to a time window with no recent runs. The project run-count check now looks back 30 days instead of the previous one-hour window.
- Bulk export compression now defaults to zstandard (zstd) for improved performance.
- Authenticated users viewing public runs now see sidebar navigation for their last selected workspace. Logged-out viewers continue to see the public run without authenticated workspace navigation.
- LangSmith now returns clearer 409 Conflict messages when duplicate run create or update payloads are submitted. The message indicates whether the duplicate was a run create or run update request when possible.
- Self-hosted LangSmith deployments now ship with high default values for bulk export concurrency limits, removing the SaaS-scale caps while keeping limits configurable via environment variables for operators who need tighter control.
- LangSmith MCP tools that fetch runs or thread history now accept project UUIDs in addition to project names, making trace URL investigations faster and less error-prone.
- OpenTelemetry resource attributes (set via OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES) now appear on traces as metadata namespaced under otel.resource.*, so you can attach details like user IDs without changing how your tracer emits spans.
- Vercel AI SDK traces sent over raw OpenTelemetry now render in the Messages view. Previously these traces showed an empty Messages tab because no format adapter claimed them.
- Thread stats requests that opt into streaming now return the main stats first and add feedback stats when they are ready.
- Native OpenTelemetry child spans are no longer dropped when they arrive before an SDK-attributed parent span; they are buffered and correctly nested regardless of arrival order.
- When a runs query times out, the runs table now shows a timeout banner for better responsiveness.
- LLM spans in the trace view now show the model provider's brand logo (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google/Gemini, Azure, Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, and speech providers), resolved from the run's ls_provider metadata.
- LangSmith now preserves traces in multipart ingestion batches when one run has oversized inputs or outputs. Oversized input and output fields are replaced with a placeholder instead of rejecting the entire batch.
- Thread pages now show an explicit access-control message when trace loading is denied by ABAC, instead of a generic retrieval error.
- All time filters in tracing views now query the full retention window instead of falling back to a shorter backend default. This keeps trace, thread, and run results consistent when expanding the time range.
- OpenTelemetry traces from VS Code Copilot Chat now render as one clean nested trace per user turn. Auxiliary title/summary calls and orphaned tool spans are suppressed, message roles are corrected, token counts are de-duplicated, and standardized metadata (integration, agent runtime, thread ID, repo/git details) is attached automatically.
- Insights cluster run stats (run count, latency, tokens, and feedback) now reflect only the runs in each cluster instead of showing the same project-wide totals for every cluster.
- LangSmith Chat now authenticates to Chat LangChain with guest tokens when searching documentation, so docs answers keep working as Chat LangChain tightens authentication.
- The Trace Messages viewer now identifies the "main" conversation for traces that include middleware guardrails or subagent side-conversations, so the message list shows only the primary interaction instead of interleaving middleware/subagent partitions. Correctness is verified by an expanded snapshot suite covering 11 integrations across LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, Vercel AI SDK, Claude Agent SDK, deepagents, and raw provider wrappers.
- Fixed a bug where non-primitive metadata values did not appear in run details.
- Custom dashboard charts can now query P50 and P99 for input and output costs without failing runs analytics requests.
- Run stats scoped to an explicit run-id list (for example Insights per-cluster stats) now compute on SmithDB, which scopes results to those runs instead of falling back to project-wide totals.
- The thread stats API now accepts a `filter` query parameter, letting you scope aggregated stats to traces matching a LangSmith filter expression (e.g. start time or trace ID).
- Organization model settings now let you search pricing rules by model name, match rule, or provider. Paginated loading fetches additional rules as you scroll, making large numbers of model price maps manageable.
- LangSmith Chat now mints Managed Deep Agent guest tokens from the Chat LangChain LangGraph host (`POST /identity/guest`) when searching documentation, instead of the legacy Chat LangChain frontend guest route.
- Assistant messages carrying tool calls were rendered twice in the v2 messages view for traces produced by the @anthropic-ai/sdk JavaScript SDK. Dedup now normalizes content-block field order so the same message emitted as an LLM output and replayed as an input on the next turn collapses to a single row.
- Tool calls in the Messages view no longer duplicate as a raw JSON block next to the tool-call widget. LangChain 1.x AI messages carry tool calls as content-level blocks with type "tool_call"; the langchain format adapter now recognizes that type instead of shipping it as a non-standard block.
- Run errors whose stack trace arrived fully escaped (no real line breaks) now render as properly formatted multi-line text instead of one long wrapped line.
- LangSmith MCP's `fetch_runs` tool now accepts `min_start_time` and `max_start_time` arguments, so agents can search traces outside the default recent window.
- Long dialogs now stay within the viewport and scroll their content, keeping titles and close controls accessible.
- Adds a `GET /v2/runs/{run_id}/url` endpoint that returns the LangSmith UI URL for a specific run.
- Trace detail back navigation no longer carries a stale run start time into the project URL, preventing incorrect 404s when opening another trace from the runs table.
- The Insights reports pane can now be collapsed to give report details more space.
- Insights cluster summary columns can now expand to show more of each summary.
- LangSmith MCP's `fetch_runs` tool now returns `first_token_time` when that value is recorded for fetched runs, making TTFT analysis available without a separate SDK query.
- Legacy run URLs now resolve the run metadata and redirect to the SmithDB trace view instead of showing an error.
- Trace usage limit banners now appear only for workspace members whose user-scoped limit has been exceeded.
- The Deployment button on tracing project pages now opens the deployment page within the app instead of reloading the UI.
- Clicking the already-selected run or trace in a thread's trace tree now keeps it selected instead of deselecting it and scrolling back to the first trace.
- Fixed two frontend call sites that could reach POST /runs/stats with an empty or missing session, preventing spurious 422 errors in the Insights job config and session rules form.
- MCP run query tools now return gateway timeout responses without retrying, reducing duplicate load when a run query times out.
- Pressing Enter to confirm characters from an input method editor (e.g. Pinyin for Chinese, or Japanese/Korean IMEs) in LangSmith Chat now commits the composed text instead of prematurely sending the message.
- LangSmith Chat now surfaces a run's system prompt inline when reading a traced LLM run, so it can explain why a model behaved a certain way without missing the system prompt. It also recognizes system prompts stored as provider-level fields (OpenAI Responses `instructions`, Anthropic `system`).
- LangSmith Chat traces now show the model you configured instead of mislabeling it as GPT-3.5-Turbo when a custom model endpoint is used.
- The Run in Studio button is now hidden on public (shared) run pages, where it previously pointed to an authenticated page that shared viewers cannot open.
- Navigating between traces now clears stale sharing state, so unshared traces no longer appear public.
- The run, trace, and thread detail panels now enforce a minimum width when resized, so their header no longer overflows and forces the view to scroll sideways.
- Restore `is_in_dataset` on trace and run responses when the query is proxied to the V1 backend in ClickHouse-only mode. The V1 select now forwards `in_dataset` so the Python backend computes it and the proxy renames it back to `is_in_dataset` for V2 callers.
- Custom dashboard charts can now query summed latency and first-token time metrics through the runs analytics SmithDB path.
- Custom dashboard charts can now query minimum and maximum latency, time-to-first-token, token, and cost values through SmithDB-backed runs analytics.
- Custom dashboard charts can now query P90 and P95 for latency, first token time, tokens, and cost metrics, in addition to the existing P50 and P99.
- Custom dashboard charts can now aggregate feedback scores by sum, P50, P90, P95, and P99, in addition to the existing average, min, and max.
- The LangSmith homepage now provides clearer onboarding steps for coding agents and tracing, including a direct shortcut for creating a tracing project.
- Self-hosted LangSmith bulk exports now default to zstandard (zstd) compression instead of gzip for improved performance.
- Tracing projects can promote any number of metadata keys to dedicated columns, so values such as customer_id or region are readable inline instead of only inside a trace. Promoted keys are shared across everyone on the project, while showing, hiding, and reordering those columns stays per user.
- Trace detail panes once again use an elevated background that matches their section headers.
- Bulk exports accept a new opt-in `feedbacks` column that carries each run's individual feedback entries, with their key and comment, as a JSON array. Add `feedbacks` to `export_fields` when creating an export; exports that omit `export_fields` keep their existing columns.
- Delete an entire trace from the run details actions menu after confirming the destructive action.
- Negative feedback-key filters now return matching traces correctly when ClickHouse uses optimized runs tables.
- When a project configures a custom output renderer, the trace Output section now offers it as a Custom option alongside Markdown, Plain, JSON, and YAML instead of replacing them. Custom stays the default, and your choice is remembered.
- The section sidebar in the manual Insights configuration no longer collapses when a panel's contents are wide, such as long model IDs on the General tab.
- Tracing project activity and sorting stay up to date for self-hosted deployments using Redis versions before 6.2.
- `POST /api/v1/runs/stats` now returns a 404 when the requested tracing project does not exist in your workspace, and reports other client errors; such as a `start_time` older than the supported lookback window; with their real status and message instead of a generic 500 internal server error.
- Self-hosted deployments now catch up missing tracing project last-run timestamps so project sorting reflects recent historical activity.
- Run filters now support total, prompt, and completion token counts and costs consistently across routed query backends.
- Token Count / Cost filters now default to total tokens / cost instead of input tokens. Input and output token / cost breakdowns remain available in the selector.
- On a tracing project, resetting a view now moves the Threads/Traces/Runs switcher back in step with the rows being shown. Previously the switcher could stay on Runs while the table had already returned to traces.
- You can now switch existing bulk export destinations between static AWS credentials and IAM role authentication through PATCH updates.
- Insights reports only analyze traces, so the "Is Trace" condition in a report's filter is now fixed. Setting it to false previously produced a report that ran successfully but never found any insights.
- LangSmith Chat now respects the Provider API setting on workspace OpenAI model configurations. Models configured for the Responses API no longer fall back to Chat Completions, which made newer reasoning models fail when a reasoning effort was set.
- Large PDF, JSON, and CSV previews on a message now render instead of showing an empty frame, and PDF and JSON previews gained an open-in-new-tab control next to the expand control.
- Creating an experiment no longer converts an existing tracing project with the same name. Rename the experiment or choose a new project name when a conflict exists.
- Trace views now source token and feedback stats from SmithDB without attempting unavailable ClickHouse queries.
- Waterfall filters in thread details now keep deeply nested matches visible and preserve filter controls while newly ingested traces are still appearing.
- Document attachments in trace content now preview from a fetched copy of the file, and "Open in New Tab" opens that same copy. A document that cannot be previewed shows a short message, with a link out when it is hosted elsewhere, instead of a blank frame.
- LangSmith MCP's `fetch_runs` tool can now include invocation parameters, including the tool and function schemas sent to an LLM, for easier tool-calling diagnosis.
- PDF attachment icons now align consistently with other file types in attachment lists.
- The thread query API now supports trace, run-tree, and thread-level filter expressions through `trace_filter`, `tree_filter`, and `thread_filter`. [Learn more](/langsmith/trace-query-syntax).
- When LangSmith Chat delegates research to subagents, their progress now appears as expandable steps under the request that started them, rather than streaming into the reply as duplicated text that disappeared when the turn finished. Chat also delegates far less often, and each subagent gets a distinct scope.
- Public shared-trace links now show a 'temporarily unavailable, try again' message when the trace query times out, instead of the misleading 'trace not found, ask the owner to re-share' message.
- Pressing M in a trace no longer switches to Messages view on surfaces that do not offer it, such as public shared traces. The Messages and Details tabs now appear only where the Messages view can actually render.
- Clicking a starter prompt without the selected model's API key configured now shows the add-a-key form, the same as typing a message, instead of failing the request.
- Public trace share links no longer time out on very large traces. The shared trace view now requests only the fields it displays, which keeps the query within its time limit.
- LangSmith Chat now offers Claude Sonnet 5 and Claude Opus 5, with Sonnet 5 as the default, and focuses the picker on Anthropic and OpenAI. Workspaces with an admin-configured default model keep their current selection.
- POST /v1/trajectory now returns a single trace's trajectory when the request carries trace_id instead of thread_id. Previously the trace_id shape returned 501.
- The Turns view in thread detail is deprecated. Use the Messages or Details view instead. LangSmith Cloud removes it on October 31, 2026; self-hosted removes it in v17.
- Hide add-thread-to-annotation-queue and thread-grouped annotation queue or webhook automations unless SmithDB queries are enabled for the instance.
- LangSmith Chat now offers GPT-5.6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Terra, and GPT-5.6 Luna alongside the existing OpenAI models.
- LangSmith now recognizes older trace links containing timestamp-prefixed run and trace IDs.
- The tracing quickstart now opens with Deep Agents selected and leads with Deep Agents, LangGraph, and LangChain framework guides.
- Trace details now surface LLM Gateway outcomes, policy limits, selected models, and fallback attempts in a dedicated Gateway section. Errored LLM runs blocked by the gateway also show a Blocked badge in the trace tree.
- Hovering a bar in the trace waterfall view now shows the same run info tooltip as the run tree, including start and end time, time to first token, token and cost breakdown, and tags.
- Insights now recommends GPT-5.6 Terra and Claude Sonnet 5 for thinking, plus GPT-5.6 Luna for OpenAI summarization.
- Opening a trace from an Insights category now keeps the trace pane header inside the pane: the header actions, including Run in Studio, switch to their compact form whenever the pane is too narrow for the full-size buttons.
- LangSmith Chat now reads as a record of what it did. Every tool it runs gets a row naming the action and what it acted on, with the result one click away; a plan appears when it takes one on, and a subagent shows the steps it is working through. Long results fold to a readable height, files and diffs render as files and diffs, and the panel can be resized or docked to the sidebar.
- Add a guard in the langchain and anthropic trajectory extractors to prevent errors when a run's messages field isn't stored as a list, consistent with the vercel and otel adapters.
- Insights category names that do not fit in the table column now show their full text on hover.
- Insights table columns can now be narrowed beyond their header labels, with full header text available on hover when truncated.
- Thread detail panes now slide into view consistently when opened from a tracing project.
- Opening a shared link to an issue now loads that specific issue, including issues marked as ignored, instead of displaying the first issue in the list.
- Runs using the bare "gpt-5.6" model id now calculate cost correctly. The pricing rule previously only matched the "gpt-5.6-sol" id variant.
- Controlled inputs no longer create redundant local state updates, preventing rare page crashes while typing in tracing filters.

### Engine

- When an Engine project reaches its monthly spend limit, the Next Run status chip and project spend card now show a clear "Monthly spend limit reached" state with a button that takes you straight to raising the limit.
- Upgrades the Redis client to improve recovery from Redis cluster topology changes, fixing cases where cluster reconnects could stall.
- Engine now lets the parent agent recover from model-actionable subtask failures and retries transient provider or network errors before failing a run. This helps issue scans continue through recoverable model errors while preserving hard failures for auth, configuration, and code exceptions.
- LangSmith exposes Engine issue listing and retrieval through hosted MCP tools and generated SDK methods. Agents and API clients can fetch issue details directly by issue ID or filter issues by project, status, severity, tag, and update time.
- A new Engine board callout points you to the trace-scope setting, where you can restrict Engine's reviews to runs matching a run name or metadata value.
- Engine-generated examples with assertions now add the Assertions evaluator when saved to a dataset from an annotation queue, matching the direct Add offline examples flow.
- The Engine setup screen now shows an estimated monthly cost based on the project's recent trace volume and size, so you know roughly what to expect before starting analysis.
- The Engine issue list now uses a single filter and sort menu with a compact, nested layout for Priority, Status, Tags, and Sort by, replacing the previous two separate popovers.
- Engine now finds the same issues using significantly fewer LCUs per run than it did at launch. A new in-app callout in the sidebar highlights the improvement and links directly to your busiest project's Issues tab.
- The Engine issue list now shows the active sort order as a removable chip next to your filter chips whenever it differs from the default.
- Engine issues can now be marked Fixing or Watching, and you can get a Slack alert when new traces recur on a watched issue.
- The Engine issue list no longer shows scan-timing details (next scan countdown, last run time, or a Run now action); a Pause/Resume control remains available in its own section in board settings.
- Engine now verifies concrete claims in agent responses against trace evidence, improving detection of ungrounded artifacts, values, and claimed actions.
- Engine issue cards now render the actual diff from the fix branch or pull request (and from Prompt and Context Hub proposals) instead of an agent-written summary, so the change you review always matches what will land.
- The organization Engine usage page now lets you switch between a workspaces view and a projects view of month-to-date LCU spend, each ranked by spend. The Engine spend API returns the authoritative total independently of the breakdown.
- Engine no longer shows redundant hover tooltips on issue category badges or the default Fix action. Permission and PR status explanations still appear when they add context.
- Engine opens the Slack or webhook destination form immediately when no destinations are configured.
- Engine issue category labels now appear on a dedicated row below the title for more consistent spacing and readability.
- Engine now shows a warning beside a linked repository when it cannot access it, including failures caused by renamed or deleted repositories and broken GitHub connections.
- On an Engine issue, navigating to the next or previous linked trace now stays in the conversation view for traces that belong to a thread, instead of switching to the single-trace view.
- Engine now shows a clickable Paused status in the issues header when scheduled scanning is paused, so you can see its status and open settings directly.
- Engine now works in supported self-hosted deployments without Eppo rollout configuration, while organization enablement and existing permissions remain enforced.
- Opening the project spend limit from the pause confirmation now scrolls the settings pane to the limit editor.
- Engine Overview now displays the current Engine package version so you can see when the underlying experience changes.
- Engine no longer emits its own LangSmith traces in self-hosted deployments, so no run content leaves the deployment. Cloud deployments are unchanged.
- A resolved issue on an Engine Issue Board now returns to Open as soon as Engine links a new matching trace to it. Previously the trace was filed as evidence but the issue stayed closed, so a problem that came back never resurfaced on the board. Dismissed issues stay dismissed.
- Engine is now enabled by default for organizations on a self-serve plan, so you can open the Engine tab on any project and start analyzing traces without an admin turning it on first. Organizations that explicitly disabled Engine stay disabled, and an admin can still turn it off under Settings → Engine.
- The issue detail header now renders category and tag badges on the same line as the title instead of stacking them underneath, tightening the header and reducing wasted vertical space.
- The "Engine failed to complete a run" trigger is no longer offered when configuring a Slack channel or webhook destination on an issue board. Destinations already subscribed to it keep receiving those notifications.
- Engine run webhooks and sandbox links now resolve the externally reachable API base from LANGSMITH_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT, falling back to LANGCHAIN_PLATFORM_ENDPOINT and then LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT. Installs whose chart set only LANGSMITH_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT were building relative URLs, which made every non-shadow Engine run fail because the run webhook was rejected as a loopback address.
- Disabling Engine for an organization or pausing it for a project now offers a short prompt asking why, with an optional comment. It takes one tap and goes straight to the team building Engine.
- Engine spend controls now explain that new runs pause at the monthly limit while runs already in progress may finish and increase billed spend beyond it.
- When Engine has watched a project long enough to stop seeing an issue recur, it now flags that issue on the board and asks you to confirm. Confirm resolves it; keep it open and Engine snoozes the prompt for a week.
- The Engine tab is visible again on tracing projects before Engine is turned on, so admins can enable it, members can request access, and personal organizations can upgrade; all from the tab itself.
- Engine GitHub settings now link to setup instructions for LangSmith Cloud and self-hosted deployments, with clearer guidance when a connection fails. [Learn more](/langsmith/engine-github).
- Engine scans on non-coding-agent boards apply the configured priority chips, user instructions, and trace-scope filter instead of reviewing the whole project.
- Scheduled Engine scans now identify confident duplicate issues and keep one canonical issue while preserving the supporting evidence.
- Engine issue descriptions now preserve Markdown paragraph boundaries so updates, additional symptoms, and corrections remain easy to scan.
- Engine now warns your organization when it has used at least 80% of its monthly Usage Credits, with a shortcut to review Engine usage.
- Engine now picks the run behind a proposed regression example for its replay value rather than reusing whichever run it linked as evidence. Evidence still points at the run that best shows the failure; often a tool span; while the example points at the run the agent would be re-run from, so promoted dataset examples actually exercise the reported behavior.
- Engine issues linked to GitHub pull requests now complete automatically when those pull requests merge, with the pull request shown in the issue history.
- The Slack channel list now refreshes in the background even when Slack rate-limits the request, so a large workspace's picker no longer goes empty after a week, and refreshing a workspace never discards a working list.
- Engine fix runs no longer push a branch for every code fix. The commit is parked on a hidden ref and the branch is created when you open a pull request, so connected repositories keep a clean branch list.
- Engine now highlights only Slack notifications in its announcement area and continues to honor prior dismissals.
- Unread Engine issues now show a lighter brand pip aligned to the right of the title, so new issues are easier to scan without competing with the title.
- Ask LangSmith Chat about an issue on the Issues Board and it reads the full record, replays the cited runs to check the failure is real, and reports what the fix branch actually changes. It can also change status and priority, open a draft pull request from the fix branch, start a new coding run, and apply a proposed prompt or context fix; each after confirming with you.
- The recurrence chart on an issue now labels its x-axis with a day-and-month axis instead of repeating the month on every tick, runs its window up to the present, and states when the issue was last seen. An issue that stopped recurring months ago no longer looks like one that recurred this morning.
- Copy Fix now pastes diagnosis, linked traces, and LangSmith CLI commands, plus a silent PR marker. When a PR in the connected repo includes that marker, Engine attaches it and shows open, closed, or merged status.
- Each row in the Engine issue list now shows the timestamp the list is sorted by, labeled and right-aligned; "Created 5d ago", "Updated 3h ago", "Seen 11m ago"; in place of the trace count. Hovering any issue date, on the row or in the issue header, shows the created, updated, and last-seen times together.
- The Engine overview no longer shows a duplicate configuration button. Engine settings remain available from the issue board toolbar.
- Sorting the Engine issue board now orders purely by the chosen field (Severity, Last Seen, Last Updated, Created, or number of traces), including resolved and dismissed issues. Status and other filters hide mismatches immediately, and each board remembers its sort and filters in the browser.
- The Fix panel can detach a linked GitHub pull request from an issue without closing it, so a different PR can be attached afterward.
- The issues API accepts a `trace_id` query parameter that returns only the issues with a run linked from that trace.
- Searching the project switcher on the Engine page now matches project names the same way the tracing project list does, instead of returning loosely-related projects.
- A pull request opened from an Engine issue now takes its title and description from the fix run's own commit message, so it explains the change a reviewer is looking at instead of restating the issue report. Every fix PR also links back to the issue it came from.
- The sidebar no longer displays the Try Engine promotional popover over the Tracing link.
- Listing Slack channels for a workspace with tens of thousands of conversations needs more than one of Slack's rate-limit windows. The background refresh now has a budget that spans them, so the picker fills instead of staying empty.
- The Slack channel picker for watching alerts now opens toward the left, keeping the full channel list visible within the issue panel.
- The Engine issue list now opens on a Default sort that leads with watched issues that have picked up new traces, then open and fixing work, then quiet watched issues, with closed and ignored ones last. Severity and last-seen order issues within each group.
- The Engine issue list's Status filter now covers triage state only; Open, Resolved, and Incorrectly Flagged; where Open includes issues with a fix in flight or under watch. A new Activity filter selects those independently, so filtering to Open no longer hides issues Engine is actively working on.
- The standalone Engine page now links directly to the selected project's tracing view.
- LangSmith Chat now reads the Issues Board beyond the issue you have open, ranking issues by what to triage first, what fired most recently, or what cites the most traces, and measuring how a board breaks down, recurs, spreads and trends over a period you choose. It also checks an issue against the traces it cites before telling you the failure is real.
- Listing Slack channels stopped after a fixed number of pages, so a workspace with tens of thousands of archived conversations had its channel list quietly cut short. Paging now runs until Slack reports the end of the list.

### Prompts and playground

- Self-hosted Playground and evaluator outbound model calls now honor proxy environment variables while preserving SSRF validation on every request.
- When you save a prompt to an application from the playground, LangSmith keeps the workspace application filter on All Applications instead of switching the rest of the UI to that application.
- Typing a workspace member's name or email in the Context Hub search box now also returns the prompts and resources they created.
- The playground now includes Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Fable 5, and Claude Opus 4.8 in the Anthropic, Bedrock, and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform model selectors. New Anthropic playground sessions default to Claude Sonnet 5.
- Playground and evaluator calls to Amazon Bedrock using IAM Trusted Entity now resolve the correct LangSmith AWS credentials before assuming customer roles in AWS-hosted LangSmith. This fixes failures that reported "Failed to assume role" before the customer role was assumed.
- Playground runs now retain evaluator scores and reasoning while backend feedback updates are polled, preventing completed results from appearing blank.
- Outbound model calls that route through a forward proxy now send the original hostname in the proxy CONNECT tunnel instead of a resolved IP, so proxies that allowlist tunnel targets by domain no longer reject them. This fixes self-hosted Playground and evaluator calls to internal OpenAI-compatible endpoints reachable only through such a proxy.
- Reviewing a prompt commit now displays every extra parameter (such as verbosity) set on the model, not just a fixed subset.
- The playground now supports Databricks chat models with configurable workspace URLs and serving endpoints. You can connect through Model Serving or Databricks AI Gateway routes and use Databricks models in evaluator workflows.
- LangSmith now waits for model preset defaults to finish loading before initializing the Playground, preventing OpenAI from replacing a custom default preset during page load.
- The model configuration default button now switches to a selected state when you make a preset your default.
- Playground model settings now apply typed custom model names when the selector closes, so you no longer need to click the typed option explicitly.
- Custom evaluator errors in the Playground results table now reliably show the failure message, instead of sometimes displaying a blank error indicator.
- Running a single dataset row through the Playground now resolves its evaluator scores, including custom code evaluators, instead of showing a feedback cell that loads indefinitely.
- Configure workspace-wide HTTPS webhooks for every Context Hub commit, with signed payloads, custom headers, and secret rotation controls.
- Custom model configs using per-model OAuth now work in the Playground, evaluators, and Insights without setting a placeholder workspace API key.
- Playground now fills in the link to open each completed run and refreshes evaluator feedback as runs finish, instead of leaving the link missing or feedback stale when polling the new runs backend.
- Editing agent and skill metadata in the Context Hub now shows save progress, reports actionable errors without discarding changes, and displays successful updates immediately.
- Prompts with a repo readme now display it in a dedicated Readme section of the prompt view.
- Gemini 3.6 Flash and Gemini 3.5 Flash Lite are now available in Fleet, Agent Builder, and playground model selectors, with usage pricing support.
- Pasting content into rich-text editors—such as the prompt playground and agent chat—now works reliably again.
- Previewing a single dataset row after running a full experiment now resolves the row's evaluator scores instead of showing a feedback cell that loads indefinitely, and the resulting feedback chips render with their proper colors.
- LangSmith no longer keeps system-added top_p values when switching OpenAI prompts to reasoning models, preventing invalid invocation parameters. Users who still need top_p can add it as an extra model parameter for supported non-reasoning models.
- When a model provider rejects a playground run; a wrong API key or an exhausted quota; the playground now shows the provider's own error message instead of a generic server error, so the cause is clear from the error itself.
- Disabled Create Agent and Create Skill buttons now explain which required details need to be added.
- Playground batch and invoke endpoints now sanitize buffered run trees into JSON-safe payloads before responding, so online evaluations no longer fail with opaque 500s when a run graph cannot be serialized.
- The prompts list no longer displays a persistent LangChain Hub banner at the bottom of the page.
- Claude models on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform now load successfully in the Playground when no credentials secret is configured, matching existing Gemini behavior under GCP Workload Identity or AWS IRSA.
- The Prompts page now supports filtering by prompt type, prompt tags, and commit tags, so you can quickly narrow the list down to the prompts you're looking for.
- Model configurations now show an inline error, instead of a silent save, when a required Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, or Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform provider field is left blank.
- The Playground now reports missing AWS credentials and other Bedrock rejections as request errors with the provider's own message, instead of a generic server error.
- Context Hub and Fleet now reject noncanonical, nonportable, or conflicting file trees before saving changes. Existing malformed repositories remain readable and accept only changes that repair the complete resulting tree; they may also be deleted as a whole.
- Context Hub repositories containing legacy files beneath linked directories can now be read, materialized, cloned, and edited. Reads use the linked directory contents, and the next successful edit removes conflicting legacy entries without changing linked repositories.

### Feedback

- Editing the score on evaluator-generated feedback (for example from the experiment comparison view) now saves correctly instead of failing with "Failed to add feedback correction".
- POST requests to add runs to an annotation queue accept an optional `extend_trace_retention` query parameter. When set to false, short-lived traces are not upgraded to extended retention. The default remains true for backward compatibility.
- Adding feedback or reviewer notes from the LangSmith UI no longer upgrades short-lived traces to extended retention. Long-lived traces are unchanged.
- Feedback statistics queries now route through the official ClickHouse client, resolving query failures and improving compatibility with ClickHouse 25.x.
- Feedback creation resolves run metadata from SmithDB when the client provides session and start time, so SmithDB-only deployments no longer depend on ClickHouse for eager feedback writes.
- Adding runs to an annotation queue via the by-key endpoint now falls back to the ClickHouse run lookup when SmithDB queries are disabled, so the SDK's annotation-queue additions work regardless of whether SmithDB is enabled.
- The POST /feedback/eager endpoint is deprecated in favor of POST /feedback and is scheduled for removal on 2026-08-10. Update any direct integrations calling /feedback/eager to use POST /feedback instead.
- Feedback creation now accepts a thread identifier, enabling feedback to be associated with a conversation thread instead of only an individual run or session.
- GET feedback requests can now filter by a thread ID within a project, making thread-level feedback retrievable without resolving a run first.
- When adding to an annotation queue from a thread or the traces table, you can now choose to enqueue the entire thread instead of a single run.
- Annotation queue rubric feedback now loads the thread-scoped feedback for thread queue items.
- Annotation queue rubric feedback now saves against the selected thread for thread queue items.
- Select threads directly from a tracing project's threads view and add them to an annotation queue in bulk.
- Delete on the annotation queue review page removes RUN and THREAD memberships via the items delete API.
- On View all items, delete selected run and thread memberships in bulk, export completed runs to CSV, and add completed runs to a dataset.
- View all items lists run and thread memberships with input/output previews so you can open any item for review.
- The review-page View item action opens an in-page run peek for RUN memberships and an in-page thread peek for THREAD memberships.
- When reviewing a thread in an annotation queue, Add to Dataset is disabled with a tooltip explaining that adding threads to datasets is not supported yet.
- The annotation queue item endpoints are now documented at their served path under /api/v1/platform, so the generated SDK methods for listing, adding, updating, counting, deleting, and placing queue items reach the API instead of returning 404.
- Opening or refreshing a link to a specific annotation queue item now loads the queue instead of stalling on a loading state.
- PDFs and other documents attached to a message now render in a full-width preview frame with a header control that opens them nearly full screen, instead of collapsing to a thumbnail-sized box.
- Feedback corrections can now reset a score to its original value, including zero.
- A long evaluator name in a feedback card's Source row now truncates instead of extending past the card, and a corrected score keeps its edit control clear of the paging arrows when a key has several entries.
- Switching a feedback value to a different category now saves even when both categories map to the same numeric score. Previously the change was silently dropped on run details and in annotation queue rubrics.
- The pencil for correcting an evaluator score is now hidden unless you have permission to update feedback. Previously it appeared for anyone who could see the score, and saving the correction failed.
- Attachments stored on a run now appear when you review it in an annotation queue, including pairwise queues. Previously only media inlined in the run's inputs or outputs was shown.
- The deprecated POST /feedback/eager endpoint has been removed. Use POST /feedback instead.

### Monitoring and alerting

- Alert chart previews now handle relative date ranges consistently, preventing failures when loading 14-day or 30-day previews.
- Dashboard chart tooltips and axes now show up to eight fractional digits (previously two), so very small costs and rates no longer round down to zero.
- Time-series charts on custom dashboards now leave gaps for missing data points instead of plotting them as zero, and lines connect across those gaps so trends remain readable.
- When a custom dashboard chart has no data or would produce too many bins, the empty state now surfaces the active stride (e.g. 1M) and selected range (e.g. Last 12 hours) so it's clear what to adjust.
- When hovering the +N chip in a dashboard chart's legend, the expanded popover now paints above adjacent chart cards instead of being clipped behind them.
- Editing a series name in the dashboard chart editor now commits on blur rather than on every keystroke, so bar colors and legend items stop flickering while you type.
- Metadata grouping keys without returned values no longer show a misleading empty value tooltip in dashboards.
- Self-hosted alert webhook delivery now honors `SSRF_ALLOW_K8S_INTERNAL`, so internal Kubernetes service hostnames can be used when that setting is enabled. Metadata endpoints, localhost, and private IP protections remain controlled by their existing SSRF policy settings.
- Asking LangSmith Chat to create a chart now retries when the model returns an incomplete response, and shows a clear message if it still can't, instead of surfacing a raw JSON parse error.
- Adds a reusable ChartCard component to the LangSmith design system, standardizing chart titles, move, expand, and overflow actions, responsive full-width layouts, and chart and legend spacing.
- Chart headers on dashboards no longer overflow or wrap when the title or description is long; the description now truncates with a hover tooltip that reveals the full text. The expand-chart action also picks up the standard icon-button hover treatment.
- Alert previews now treat integer metadata and its string representation consistently with alert evaluation.
- In dashboards and other surfaces where "All time" is unavailable, clearing both dates in the date picker now disables Apply instead of silently submitting an all-time range that fails to load.
- Opening a run from a dashboard chart's runs table now shows a single trace pane instead of stacking a second, identical pane behind the first.
- Create and edit alert actions now remain in a sticky footer, so you can submit changes without scrolling to the bottom of the form. [Learn more](/langsmith/alerts).
- The Streaming rate over time template now divides runs with a first token time by LLM runs only, so a new chart matches the streaming rate shown elsewhere in LangSmith.
- Adds a reusable BarChart component to the LangSmith design system, standardizing grouped and stacked bars, horizontal and vertical layouts, multiple value axes, threshold bands, interactions, and keyboard accessibility.
- Webhook test notifications now show the destination's HTTP status and reason phrase, helping you diagnose URL, availability, and authentication failures.

### Automations

- Applying a prebuilt evaluator without a filter now defaults to running on root runs only, matching manually created evaluators. Previously it ran on every nested run in a trace.
- Turning an online evaluator or automation on or off now saves for any role that can edit rules, instead of silently reverting for members without the retention-configuration permission.
- Resolved an unbounded memory leak in the SAQ queue worker where croniter objects were rebuilt every second, accumulating cached entries that were never released. The croniter dependency is bumped to 6.2.2+ and croniter objects are now reused across schedule ticks.
- Creating an online evaluator (LLM-as-judge or custom code) no longer intermittently fails when sandbox validation is slow.
- Thread (grouped) evaluators now require a minimum idle time of 120 seconds. Setting a project's thread idle time below 120s is rejected.
- Leaving feedback on a run in a thread now makes the thread eligible for re-evaluation, so thread-level evaluators re-run when new feedback arrives.
- Editing an online evaluator (LLM-as-judge or custom code) no longer intermittently fails when sandbox validation is slow.
- On a tracing project, LangSmith Chat can now fill in the New Evaluator panel for you; an LLM-as-judge grounded in a failure it found in your runs, with the prompt, feedback keys, model, sampling and filter already set. Ask it to revise anything, then review and press Create yourself.
- Forking an evaluator attaches the copy to the project or dataset named in the fork dialog. Previously the copy could be created attached to nothing, leaving the original evaluator running the version you had just edited away from.
- Turning off few-shot corrections for an LLM-as-judge evaluator now removes the few-shot prompt section when saved and persists the disabled setting.
- LLM-as-judge evaluations no longer add an examples_few_shot input when the prompt does not use few-shot examples, so missing-input errors only show relevant fields.
- Non-admin users can now use "Annotate for alignment" to create an evaluator's alignment annotation queue for the first time without hitting a retention-permission error.
- Manually triggering an automation rule through the API now works. `POST /runs/rules/{rule_id}/trigger` and the `rule_ids` form of `POST /runs/rules/trigger` previously returned a 500 for every request.
- You can manually trigger any automation in your workspace, including webhook-only, alert-only, and extend-retention rules. Previously the trigger endpoint only recognized a subset of actions and returned not found for the rest.
- Online evaluators configured with an OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible custom endpoint now use that endpoint's own URL and API key on live traces instead of failing with an authentication error. Evaluators on custom endpoints are not counted toward evaluator spend limits.
- Online evaluators configured with a saved custom provider model configuration (OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible) now use that configuration's endpoint and credentials correctly on live traces, instead of failing with a permission error.
- Non-admin users can now save evaluator edits from the dataset, tracing project, and thread panes without hitting a retention-permission error.
- Automations grouped by thread can now add one annotation queue item for each matched conversation, so reviewers can inspect the whole thread instead of only an individual run.
- Thread webhook and annotation-queue automations now show thread filters instead of run filters, and no longer default to Is Trace = true.
- Automation rules scoped to threads now show the project's thread idle time, with a link to change it in project settings.

## Deployment

- Self-hosted deployments can now request CPU and memory above the previous Cloud limits of 8/16 cores and 32/16 GB, bounded only by your cluster capacity. Lower bounds, multiple-of-128 granularity, and Redis memory ordering are still enforced.
- Custom Slack app triggers can now opt in to let third-party bots trigger an agent. Enable the allow bot triggers toggle on a registration to accept events from external bots; echoes from your own and other LangSmith-registered bots are still dropped to prevent loops.
- Agents now skip unreachable or misconfigured non-default MCP servers immediately instead of retrying them, removing a slow round-trip from the tool-loading step and cutting time-to-first-token.
- Standby (uptime) minutes for LangGraph Platform deployments could be billed more than once when replicas reported overlapping intervals across separate usage-reporting runs. Reporting now deduplicates each minute across runs so it is billed at most once.
- The multi-select dropdown (e.g. Selected Tools) on the Studio assistants page now renders above the configuration dialog instead of behind it, so its options are visible and selectable.
- Deleting a LangGraph deployment now tears down its running resources after a one-hour grace period and permanently removes its database and metadata one week later, leaving a window to recover from an accidental deletion.
- Redis connections using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure IAM) authentication now re-authenticate automatically before the access token expires, so long-lived connections no longer drop. Clustered Azure Redis is now supported for IAM auth as well.
- The deployment Crons tab now shows each schedule in your local timezone instead of raw UTC, matching the Next Run Date column.
- The deployment Monitoring page now charts p50 and p99 run queue wait time; how long each run waited in the queue before its first attempt.
- LangSmith Deployment now supports updating a deployment to a fixed resource tier through the control plane API. The update applies the selected tier's resource configuration, resizes Cloud SQL or RDS, and rolls a new revision.
- You can now edit an existing cron's schedule, input, and end time from a deployment's Crons tab, instead of deleting and recreating it.
- You can now rename a deployment from its Settings; give it a friendly display name without recreating it. The deployment's URLs and infrastructure are unchanged.
- Deployment detail pages now keep the API URL visible when the details panel overflows, including on Preview Builds pages at 100% browser zoom.
- LangSmith frontend images now install nginx 1.31 packages to pick up the latest Chainguard security fixes.
- Deployment creation now checks free deployment usage with the same backend quota count used during submission, preventing the form from offering a free Serverless or Development option when the organization quota is already used.
- LangSmith Deployment now lets you update compute and database resource tiers independently for supported hosted deployments. The scaling action applies the selected resources and rolls out a new revision.
- Hosted project deployment views now label scale-to-zero development deployments as Serverless, with free deployments shown as Serverless (free).
- The deployment form now shows the free serverless option immediately while checking an organization's remaining deployment allowance.
- Refines error handling when attempting to create a deployment with no GitHub repository selected.
- Serverless deployments can now update compute tiers correctly without requiring an external database tier.
- Self-hosted deployments now authenticate correctly to node-based AWS ElastiCache with IAM in both single-node and cluster configurations.
- Worker and API server CPU charts now plot a peak (max) series alongside the average, so a single replica with high CPU usage is no longer hidden by the fleet-wide average.
- Worker and API server memory charts now plot a peak (max) series alongside the average, so a single replica approaching its memory limit is no longer hidden by the fleet-wide average.
- Creating a deployment with a name that's already in use within your workspace now returns a 409 Conflict instead of a 500 error.
- Hybrid deployments remain compatible with older listeners during control-plane upgrades, preventing new deployments from remaining queued.
- The Create New Deployment form now shows a clear, per-field message when a submitted value fails validation (e.g. an invalid image path) instead of the raw backend error payload.
- Rolling back a deployment, or redeploying it without changing anything, now reuses the image that was already built instead of building it again. Deploys that do change the code, the build commands, or an environment variable still build a new image.
- Deleting a tracing project whose LangGraph deployment is still within its post-deletion retention window now schedules the project to be removed along with the deployment, and explains that in the error message instead of asking you to delete a deployment you already deleted.
- The delete confirmation for a LangGraph deployment now says that cleanup of the underlying database runs after you confirm, and that a deleted deployment's name stays reserved until that cleanup finishes.
- A revision now records the environment variables it was created with, so rolling back deploys the code and the configuration together instead of running the older revision with your current values. Revisions created before this change keep using the deployment's current environment variables, and rolling back to one of them rebuilds the image.
- Self-hosted deployment forms now support Redis CPU and memory requests and limits. The configured values are applied to the Redis workload managed by the Kubernetes operator.
- GitHub deployment revisions continue to show the repository ref and commit SHA after a built image URI is recorded.
- Deployments that use a platform-default LangGraph API version now correctly reuse matching images instead of starting unnecessary rebuilds.
- Managed Deep Agent deployments entering public preview report their normal deployment usage.
- Rolling back a deployment that was created from an uploaded source archive now redeploys that revision's archive instead of the most recent one.
- Studio's chat pane no longer shows a 'No data' placeholder between sending a message and the first streamed token. The assistant message now appears once it has content to show.
- A Managed Deep Agent deployment's Details sidebar now links to the Context Hub repo holding its deployed instructions, skills, and memories. Archived repos are labelled so it is clear when the context is no longer live.
- Studio chat now shows elapsed response status, preserves complete streamed responses, and follows new output without interrupting readers who scroll up.
- Configure the pull request base branch used to create previews when a deployment is pinned to a Git tag.
- PDFs attached directly in the Studio chat pane now retain their file data and preview without an error.
- Preview builds now use serverless deployment infrastructure for organizations with serverless development deployments enabled, including topology-safe cluster placement.
- LangSmith services now accept both IPv4 and IPv6 connections.
- Deployments now resolve the latest agent server version more reliably, preventing slow revision creation and duplicate revisions caused by request timeouts, particularly in Asia Pacific.
- LangSmith workers using Microsoft Entra ID authentication for standalone Redis now start successfully and continue refreshing credentials after the event loop starts.
- Studio chat now shows results for provider built-in tools such as web_fetch and web_search, and groups a run of consecutive tool calls into a single collapsible entry instead of one row per call.
- Self-hosted deployment forms now preserve fractional CPU request and limit values for application and queue containers.
- GCP Redis IAM cluster discovery now uses TLS when Redis cluster TLS is enabled, allowing self-hosted deployments to combine IAM authentication with TLS-required Memorystore clusters.
- Studio switches deployment and connection controls to compact icons when the graph pane is narrow, preventing toolbar actions from overlapping.
- Deployment Overview now surfaces high Postgres disk usage and pending run counts, so operators can spot issues without opening Monitoring.

## Sandboxes

- Sandbox command output is now re-chunked into bounded single WebSocket frames, so clients that do not reassemble continuation frames (including the Go SDK) can read large streamed or replayed output without truncated JSON.
- S3 sandbox mounts now default endpoint_url to https://s3.amazonaws.com when it is not provided, so the field is no longer required when mounting standard AWS S3 buckets.
- Sandboxes can now burst CPU up to 2x their requested allocation when the host has spare capacity, and you can request fractional (sub-core) vCPU down to 0.05.
- When creating a sandbox, you can now configure Git, S3, and GCS filesystem mounts, including mount paths, Git remotes, bucket settings, and cache options. Configured mounts appear in the sandbox table and detail view.
- The LangSmith SDKs now support creating, listing, updating, and deleting sandbox registries for pulling private container images, alongside the existing sandbox and snapshot operations.
- Sandbox snapshots now work like Docker images. Give a snapshot a name and tag when you create it; building from a Docker image carries that image's tag across by default, and snapshotting a running sandbox defaults to latest; then boot from name:tag, where a bare name means name:latest. Publishing a new snapshot at an existing name:tag moves the tag to it and leaves the previous snapshot in place, still bootable by id, so promoting a build and rolling one back are the same operation; there is no separate retag step. Anywhere the API accepts a snapshot id it now accepts a reference too: sandbox create takes a single snapshot field holding an id, a name:tag, or a bare name, and fetching a bare name lists every tag under it with the snapshot each one resolves to. Snapshots also get their own permissions; snapshots:create, snapshots:delete, and snapshots:update; shown as a Snapshots section when editing a role, and existing roles keep the access they already had. A snapshot name belongs to whoever first published under it, who can keep publishing freely; anyone else needs snapshots:update, because moving a shared tag changes what the owner's sandboxes boot. Snapshot names are taggable, so an access policy can grant or deny that permission on names carrying particular tags and let a team share a name instead of one person owning it.
- Sandbox creation no longer fails intermittently with "sandbox not ready" errors when an underlying host is disrupted. Affected capacity now retries the contended resource lock and recovers automatically instead of leaving the pool degraded.
- Sandbox host startup now validates the full version directory before reuse, so a missing initrd no longer causes create-time failures after a partial or stale install.
- Creating a sandbox snapshot from a Docker image now records the image's tag (e.g. ubuntu:24.04 becomes the 24.04 tag), and creating a sandbox from a snapshot name without a tag resolves the latest tag, mirroring Docker.
- Self-hosted LangSmith installations now show the Sandboxes navigation item and use the instance-level sandbox flag to open the Sandboxes page.
- Shells and tools inside a sandbox now report the sandbox's name as the hostname instead of a generic default, and the name resolves from within the sandbox.
- Self-hosted LangSmith installations can open the Sandboxes page without enabling the Deployments frontend.
- Sandboxes now set common CA-bundle environment variables by default, so Python, Node, Deno, curl, and git tooling automatically trusts the sandbox's egress proxy certificate and no longer fails with TLS certificate-verification errors when its traffic is proxied.
- Sandboxes can now opt into keeping their memory when they stop, so the next start resumes where it left off instead of cold-booting. Set preserve_memory_on_stop when creating a sandbox; it defaults to off.
- A sandbox proxy configuration can now define environment variables that are applied to every command in the sandbox. This is handy when a tool refuses to run unless a credential env var is present (for example gh needs GH_TOKEN) even though the egress proxy injects the real credential on the wire; set a placeholder value so the command starts.
- Attach free-form key/value labels when creating a sandbox or snapshot. Labels are stored and returned on reads; sandboxes inherit their snapshot's labels, and snapshots built from a Docker image inherit the image's labels.
- Sandbox network egress now tries every resolved IP for a destination instead of only the first, so requests to multi-homed hosts (for example apt package mirrors) no longer fail when the first address is unreachable on the requested port.
- Creating a sandbox with only mem_bytes set now derives a matching CPU allocation automatically, so requests for larger-memory sandboxes no longer need an explicit vcpus value to satisfy the CPU-to-memory ratio.
- Sandboxes accept a new streaming execute request that returns stdout and stderr as Server-Sent Events, for clients that cannot hold a WebSocket. Passing a command ID reuses a running command, and a separate resume request continues an interrupted stream instead of running the command again.
- Sandboxes now ship with the `langsmith` CLI on PATH, so agents can query traces, runs, and datasets without installing it first.
- Sandbox and snapshot rows now use single-column layouts with actions in context menus, snapshot sources remain available in their menus, and wrapped names stay left-aligned.
- Engine sandbox commands in self-hosted deployments now authenticate over WebSocket with the deployment service key, preventing 401 failures after successful sandbox creation.
- The `langsmith` CLI in sandboxes is updated to v0.2.44. Its requests now resolve on self-hosted deployments that serve the API under `/api`, where commands such as `trace messages` and the project issues commands previously failed.
- Resuming a suspended sandbox now checks your organization's real sandbox quota, including plan-specific limits, instead of the default cap. Requests that genuinely exceed quota return 429 with a quota message rather than 502 Bad Gateway.
- Self-hosted LangSmith now enables sandbox API and UI access only when the deployment license includes sandbox access.
- Online self-hosted LangSmith installations now report finalized sandbox uptime and resource usage for billing when phone-home usage reporting is enabled. Offline and opted-out installations do not send sandbox usage.
- Mounting a git repository into a sandbox no longer fails silently. Clones now trust the sandbox's certificate bundle, so the repository is available at its mount path instead of the sandbox starting with an empty directory.
- Sandboxes now retain recent CPU, memory, and network usage history, making it easier to understand resource consumption and diagnose performance bottlenecks.
- WebSocket connections through a sandbox service URL now reach your service with their query string intact. Dev servers that authenticate their own WebSocket with a query parameter, such as Vite's HMR token, now connect instead of failing.
- Sandboxes now mount Context Hub repositories through a read-only, host-served filesystem, so files are directly accessible without polling for asynchronous guest materialization. Repository updates appear atomically, and mounts recover across memory-backed stop and start.
- Attach a free-form description when creating or capturing a snapshot, and to proxy rules and proxy configs. Descriptions are stored and returned on reads, so you can hand an agent a plain-language summary of what its sandbox image and network access can do.
- Sandbox file downloads now accept a Range header, so you can fetch part of a large file or resume an interrupted transfer instead of starting over. Responses carry an ETag for safe resumes and the same path answers HEAD, reporting a file's size without transferring it.
- You can now mint a signed link that downloads a single sandbox file with no LangSmith credential, so files can be handed to a browser or any client that cannot carry an API key. Links are served from the sandbox service domain, never expire unless you set expires_in_seconds, and can pin the response content type and disposition. A link's content is cached indefinitely, so mint a new link when the file changes.
- Sandbox proxy rules and callbacks no longer accept match_hosts patterns like `*.com` or `*.co.uk`, which would have sent injected credentials to every host under a top-level domain. Wildcards must now name a registrable domain, such as `*.example.com`.
- GET /v2/sandboxes/boxes now pages with page_size and an opaque cursor, returning items and next_cursor. The limit and offset parameters and the sandboxes and offset response fields still work but are deprecated.
- Updating a sandbox's proxy configuration no longer requires the sandbox to be running. A stopped sandbox stores the new configuration and applies it the next time it starts, instead of rejecting the request.
- GET /v2/sandboxes/snapshots now pages with page_size and an opaque cursor, returning items and next_cursor. The limit and offset parameters and the snapshots and offset response fields still work but are deprecated.

## Administration

- The roles table on the Organization Roles settings page now scrolls correctly when there are more roles than fit on screen.
- A new Project and user limits tab on the enterprise Usage configuration page lets you set monthly trace-count limits scoped to a specific project or user. Add, edit, and delete limits from the page.
- Anonymous organizations now show an "Anonymity mode is on" banner on the members page, and the usage breakdown hides the group-by-user option for non-internal viewers.
- New API keys now default to a finite expiration date instead of requiring a custom value. When an organization enforces a shorter maximum, the form defaults to that maximum instead.
- You can now fetch a single workspace directly via GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id} instead of listing all workspaces and filtering client-side.
- Org and workspace admins can now edit the role of a pending member invite directly from the Members settings page, without needing to cancel and re-send the invite.
- The Usage limits page now shows each workspace's configured total and extended (long-lived) trace limits, including caps that were previously hidden while the spend limit displayed "Unlimited".
- The batch workspace invite endpoint no longer returns a 409 error when inviting users who are already pending org invitees or active org members. Those users are added directly to the workspace without requiring a new org invite.
- The role selector in the edit pending member invite dialog now uses a scrollable select, matching the invite flow. This ensures all custom roles are accessible when many workspace roles are defined.
- Self-hosted deployments can now encode spaces in the OIDC authorization request as %20 instead of +, so single sign-on works with identity providers that reject the default + encoding of the scope list. Enable it by setting OAUTH_URL_ENCODE_SCOPE_SPACES=true.
- Billing upgrade dialogs now stay within the viewport and scroll when payment or business details make the form taller than the screen.
- Non-admin callers with manage-members permission can no longer assign restricted roles to workspace members or invite users with restricted roles to the workspace.
- Filter the organization's service keys and personal access tokens by workspace on the API keys settings page.
- Users without workspaces:manage permission cannot use restricted roles for invites, role changes, or user deletions in the UI.
- Organization admins can disable model providers across every workspace from organization settings. Disabled providers are hidden in the playground, evaluators, Fleet, and other model pickers, and workspace admins cannot re-enable them.
- Adding existing active or pending organization members to a workspace no longer fails when organization-level invites are disabled. Disabled org invites continue to block new organization invitees.
- The Roles settings page now scrolls correctly when an organization has more roles than fit on screen.
- Organization admins can once again edit the role of and remove other organization admins from the Organization Members settings page. Organization Operators, who share the same admin-level permissions but should not manage other admins, are now correctly prevented from editing, removing, or promoting members to Organization Admin.
- The email confirmation page now shows only the Confirm account step in the sidebar instead of future onboarding steps you have not reached yet.
- Self-hosted deployments now apply explicit DEFAULT_ORG_FEATURE_* and DEFAULT_FEATURE_* environment variables over stored organization and tenant config values, so operators can enable or disable features and limits globally without editing Postgres.
- The navigation product switcher now shows the configured organization logo alongside the LangSmith or Fleet wordmark instead of repeating the organization logo.
- Organization admins can now toggle role restriction from the Roles settings page. Restricted roles can only be assigned by users with the workspaces:manage permission.
- Workspace API key creation and deletion is now gated by a new workspaces:manage-keys permission, separate from workspaces:manage. Organization admins can grant a custom workspace role the ability to manage API keys without granting full workspace management.
- The organization-wide public sharing toggle now lives on the General settings page alongside the other organization settings, replacing its standalone Configuration section.
- When a user is removed from all mapped SSO groups, the organization and workspace access granted through SSO group sync is revoked on their next sign-in. Access assigned by other means (SCIM, JIT, or manual invitation) is unaffected.
- Workspace invite batch requests are now rate limited per workspace to reduce bulk invitation abuse. [Learn more](/langsmith/usage-and-billing#workspace-invite-batch-endpoint).
- Workspace switcher labels now show the full workspace name on hover when the visible label is truncated. This makes similarly prefixed workspace names easier to distinguish.
- LangSmith Home now shows a banner promoting Interrupt, our agent conference in London and NYC this fall, with a link to get tickets.
- Some new users could get stuck on the last onboarding step, with a loading spinner that never finished. This is now fixed.
- Organization admins can now rename their organization directly from the organization switcher in settings.
- Enforce annotation-queues:* permissions through ABAC.
- Organization admins can now generate, view, and delete SCIM bearer tokens directly from Settings > Access and Security, instead of using the API, to set up SCIM provisioning with their identity provider. [Learn more](/langsmith/user-management#set-up-scim-for-your-organization).
- Selecting All Workspaces on the Granular Billable Usage page now loads usage successfully for organizations with many workspaces.
- The Granular Usage page now shows a notice that long-lived trace usage isn't tracked in self-hosted deployments, so the "Long-lived only" filter is expected to show zero results there.
- The LangSmith home page now provides quick access to copy the current organization and workspace IDs.
- On self-hosted installations authenticating with OAuth/SSO, the Remote MCP authorization endpoint returned a 400 because the SSO login route shadowed it. OAuth clients can now complete the authorize step and connect to the Remote MCP server.
- Self-hosted deployments with an online license key (beacon access) now see the monthly organization usage graph automatically, without needing the enable_monthly_usage_charts org config. Offline deployments are now pointed to the Granular usage tab for locally-recorded billable usage.
- Switching workspaces or organizations keeps you on the same page when the route has no workspace-specific resource IDs. Routes that reference a specific resource continue to open the destination workspace home page.
- LangSmith now refreshes expired browser sessions and retries interrupted API requests before asking you to log in again.
- Update ABAC access policies and detach policies from roles through the public API.
- Organization admins can now view a record of write operations performed in their organization, filterable by time range, from Settings > Audit logs.
- Access-policy endpoints now report errors as RFC 7807 problem details. Error messages move from the `error` field to `detail`, and semantically invalid request bodies return HTTP 422.
- Set a resource tag key or value description to `null` to clear it through the PATCH API.
- New connections to the hosted LangSmith MCP server failed to register when the client requested a confidential authentication method. Dynamic client registration now issues a public client in that case instead of returning an error, so connecting from Claude and other MCP clients works again.
- The organization submenu now opens when you hover over the organization row in the footer menu.
- Self-hosted deployments refresh their license every 5 minutes instead of every 24 hours, so entitlement changes take effect shortly after they are made. A failed refresh no longer restarts the service; it keeps using the last verified license until that license's own expiry. The tuning knob is now LICENSE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS (default 300), replacing LICENSE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_HOURS.
- Role permission and access policy changes now invalidate cached authorization results reliably, including when an older transaction commits after a newer update.
- LangSmith now refreshes cached role access policies as soon as their permissions change, preventing stale authorization decisions in split-plane deployments.
- LangSmith now explains when a workspace cannot be deleted because it is the only default workspace in the organization's SSO configuration. The error directs administrators to add another default workspace before retrying.
- Searching workspaces with Cmd+K now highlights the query in the organization heading, making it clear why a term that matches an organization name returns all of that organization's workspaces.
- The account menu now offers Get help. Enterprise users can submit a support request in LangSmith, while other cloud users are directed to the Support Portal.
- The Active, Pending, and Deactivated tabs on the Members settings page now switch on the first click while keeping pagination and sorting in sync.
- The Plans and pricing page now preserves browser back and forward trackpad gestures and centers the plan cards.
- The API keys settings page now paginates large key lists, keeping the page responsive for organizations with many service keys or personal access tokens.
- API key, personal access token, and SCIM token settings now show the user who created each credential.
- The signup page animation stays aligned with the hero content after the confirmation message appears.
- Users with the tag-on-create permission for datasets, projects, or prompts can now see and apply tags when creating those resources, instead of only workspace managers.
- The API Keys page now filters keys across the full paginated list by key, description, and workspace.
- The organization usage dashboard renders its charts again; they previously could appear blank even when usage data was present, showing only the workspace legend.
- Organization admins can now delete custom roles from the roles settings page. Roles still in use by a user, SCIM group, or SSO settings cannot be deleted until reassigned.
- Each data plane card in organization settings now has a copy button next to its name, so you can grab the data plane ID without opening dev tools.
- Custom roles can now grant feedback-configs:create, feedback-configs:update, and feedback-configs:delete independently of feedback submission, so a role can be scoped to submitting feedback without also being able to create, edit, or delete feedback config (rubric) definitions.
- Billing settings now name the two credit tabs Credit usage (previously Contract usage) and Credit grants (previously Credits). Credit usage tracks burndown against your prepaid gateway credits.
- The Storybook overview now links every component card to its dedicated page and shows accurate progress examples.
- The login CAPTCHA now appears beside the active email or SSO field while preserving entered form values when switching methods.
- Workspace roles can grant API key creation and deletion without granting full workspace administration. Key managers can scope service keys to permitted workspaces and assign unrestricted roles.

### LLM Gateway

- LLM gateway data protection policies can now configure whether a guard pipeline timeout allows the request through or blocks it. Existing policies default to allowing requests on timeout.
- The LLM gateway now supports POST /openai/v1/responses/compact (and the legacy /responses/compact), routing it through the chat-shape responses handler.
- Guard policies now let you choose which PII rule categories to detect, with separate faster rule-based and slower model-based detection options, instead of a single on/off PII toggle.
- Gateway guard secret redaction now detects additional token formats, including SendGrid API tokens, Google OAuth access tokens, JWTs, Slack webhook URLs, and legacy LangSmith keys.
- The LLM gateway now accepts request bodies up to 60 MiB, up from 10 MiB, so requests carrying large images or file inputs are no longer rejected with a 413.
- When a gateway spend-cap policy targets more than one user, workspace, or API key, the create/edit policy form now explains that the limit applies to the combined spend across the selected entities rather than per entity.
- The LLM gateway now forwards every documented OpenAI API route it does not handle directly (models, files, batches, images, and more) to the upstream provider, so clients can reach the full OpenAI surface through the gateway. Custom OpenAI-compatible providers inherit the same passthrough routes.
- The LLM Gateway policies page now lets you sort each section by spend limit or usage percentage, and filter down to a specific workspace, user, or API key.
- LLM gateway data protection redaction now prepends a short disclaimer to redacted message text so models know SAFE_TO_USE placeholders are safe to reuse verbatim.
- The LLM Gateway now proxies Anthropic's Files and Managed Agents endpoints, so you can use them with your gateway-managed workspace key alongside Messages and Models.
- Creating an LLM Gateway spend or data protection policy now applies to the organization you are signed in to, replacing the organization dropdown with a read-only display of the current organization.
- Long selected values, like a user's email in the Gateway Policies filter, now truncate with an ellipsis instead of overlapping the dropdown chevron.
- The Gateway Monitoring date range controls no longer let you page forward into a future period with no spend; the next-period control is disabled once the window reaches the present.
- The LLM Gateway now accepts workspace-scoped LangSmith OAuth bearer tokens across its provider routes, so OAuth clients can invoke configured models without a LangSmith API key.
- Gateway Monitoring now shows spend for the workspace you're viewing rather than the whole organization, with a dropdown to switch workspaces from the page. Spend cards show N/A instead of a repeated error message when a workspace's gateway project can't be resolved.
- The Rate Limiting tab in Gateway Policies now supports creating, editing, deleting, and enabling/disabling request- and token-based rate-limit policies, alongside the existing cost-control and data-protection policy management.
- Editing a materialized LLM Gateway policy now turns it into a standalone override, preventing later default policy changes from overwriting its custom limits.
- You can now call LangChain-managed models through the LLM gateway without configuring your own provider credentials. Usage is metered at cost and bounded by a monthly spend cap based on your plan; once the cap is reached, further requests are blocked until the next month. The cap can be raised on request. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway-langchain-provider).
- Selecting an entity filter on the LLM Gateway spend monitoring page no longer flips the breakdown to a different dimension.
- Selecting more than one entity in any Gateway Monitoring breakdown filter (model, user, or API key) now returns spend for all chosen entities instead of no data.
- The Gateway Monitoring spend chart now formats axis labels and tooltip ranges in UTC to match its UTC-anchored buckets, so viewers in non-UTC timezones no longer see off-by-one dates.
- The LLM Gateway spend chart and table now label spend from service keys as "Unaffiliated with any user" instead of showing a blank name, with a tooltip explaining that the spend came from a workspace/org-scoped key rather than an individual.
- API-key-scoped LLM Gateway spend-cap and rate-limit policies can now add a custom X-Gateway-* header condition, so a single API key can match different limits per header value; for example, a reseller can set separate caps per downstream customer without distributing multiple keys.
- Stat card and table headers in the LLM Gateway monitoring page's Spend tab (e.g. "Total Spend", "Daily Avg", "API Key") now capitalize every word, matching the header style used elsewhere in the product.
- When a specific start/end date is selected in the LLM Gateway monitoring page's date range picker, the button now shows the dates in UTC and appends "(UTC)" so it's clear the range doesn't follow your local timezone. Relative ranges like "Last 7 days" are unaffected.
- The "Spend share" column on the LLM Gateway Monitoring spend dashboard no longer cuts off its header text.
- The LLM Gateway now lives in a dedicated top-level sidebar section instead of under Settings, with a new Home tab listing your custom model configurations and a ready-to-run code snippet for the gateway. Old Settings gateway links redirect automatically.
- A Home banner for LangSmith Cloud orgs with LLM Gateway enabled highlights how Gateway manages costs and improves runtime reliability. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
- Gateway policies with a blank or whitespace-only name now fall back to showing the policy ID instead of rendering an empty name cell, and the policy update endpoint now rejects blank names the same way creation already does.
- The Gateway usage spend chart now shows the top 12 individual spenders per bucket, rolling the rest into an "Other" series, and its hover tooltip lists every contributor at once with the bucket total pinned beneath them.
- The home page onboarding flow now includes a step for choosing how your agent reaches a model: bring your own provider API key, or use Gateway Credits. Choosing Gateway Credits lets an organization admin pre-purchase prepaid credit and shows the API key and gateway URL needed to start sending traffic, with no provider account required.
- The custom X-Gateway-* header condition on LLM Gateway spend-cap and rate-limit policies now works with organization-, workspace-, and user-scoped policies too, not just API-key-scoped ones. You can split a single subject's traffic into separate caps by header value regardless of how the policy is scoped.
- LLM Gateway dashboard filters now list selected items first and sort items alphabetically within each group.
- Default spend cap and rate limit policies in LLM Gateway now expand to show the per-user, per-workspace, and per-API-key policies materialized underneath them.
- The Gateway Credits purchase dialog now shows the credit balance your purchase will land you on, and states the fee-inclusive total directly above a single purchase button. Large amounts no longer push the credits readout and total outside the dialog.
- Enterprise organizations without Data Protection now see the tab in the LLM Gateway, greyed out with a link to request access, instead of the tab being hidden entirely.
- The connect card now appears above the Gateway Credits balance on the LLM Gateway Home page, and the generated code snippets list the API key before the base URL to match common convention.
- Generating an API key from the LLM Gateway Home connect card now shows the standard one-time key reveal dialog, and each provider's "Configured" status now reflects the workspace's actual secrets instead of a fixed list.
- The "Purchase Credits" button on LLM Gateway Home now opens the credit purchase dialog instead of showing a "coming soon" message, and the balance bar now shows spend against what's actually purchased instead of against the plan's purchase limit.
- The Cost Controls and Model Fallbacks shortcuts on LLM Gateway Home now read "View cost controls"/"View model fallbacks" for members who can't manage the org, instead of "Manage"/"Configure".
- Gateway Home code samples now use the gateway hostname constructed for each LangSmith region and default to the Responses API where supported. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
- LLM Gateway policy tabs now clarify that policies apply across the organization, while Usage clarifies that spend is scoped to the selected workspace.
- The home onboarding step now states your Gateway Credits balance in US dollars, matching the amount you purchase, instead of converting it to LCUs.
- The prompt you copy into your coding agent during onboarding now states how the agent should reach a model, based on the provider you picked: Gateway Credits, or your own provider API key.
- Homepage spacing and surface tinting now match design review feedback, and several small copy fixes clarify credit limits, provider status, and organization-level purchase limits.
- LLM Gateway Home again includes Google Gemini and generates valid model identifiers for Gemini and Baseten connect samples. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
- LLM Gateway Home now highlights the selected model and lets you switch connect samples between Chat Completions, Messages, and Responses formats.
- The LLM Gateway Usage tab now explains when usage queries aren't available for a deployment instead of showing failed dashboard requests.
- When you select Gateway Credits during onboarding, the prompt copied into your coding agent now includes the correct Gateway URL for your deployment. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
- Gateway Credits checkout now remains on the active purchase step while a free workspace upgrades to the Developer plan, instead of briefly showing the saved-card view before closing.
- Requests that set prompt_cache_options (or the deprecated prompt_cache_retention) now enable Anthropic prompt caching when the LLM Gateway translates an OpenAI Chat Completions or Responses request to a Claude model, instead of ignoring the field. Anthropic's default cache lifetime applies, and prompt_cache_key, prompt_cache_retention, and prompt_cache_options are all preserved when translating between the Chat Completions and Responses formats.
- Tooltips on disabled LLM Gateway policy controls now read "You need organization admin access to create policies" instead of referencing the raw organization:manage permission string.
- The Gateway Usage tab no longer shows an in-page workspace dropdown; the page is already scoped to your current workspace, and its subtitle now names that workspace directly.
- Adding a provider API key now starts from a provider picker that fills in the correct secret key name for you, with a Custom option for anything else. In the LLM Gateway you can add a provider's required secret without leaving the connect screen.
- Requests to moonshotai/kimi-k3 and moonshotai/kimi-k2.6 through gateway credit models in the LLM gateway are now matched against a price map when sent in user-traced code.
- Chat model runs sent through the gateway's unified endpoint with provider/model slugs now match model pricing rules, producing accurate trace costs.
- LLM Gateway Usage now provides interactive spend legends, consistent chart layouts, and tooltips that stay visible. Single-series views clearly explain spend that is not affiliated with a user instead of showing an empty chart.
- You can now purchase as little as $4.50 in Gateway Credits, equivalent to 3 LCUs.
- Bedrock requests through the LLM gateway now use the Amazon Bedrock price map so their costs are calculated correctly.
- The credit balance now shows above the connect card, and the shortcut cards for cost controls, model fallbacks, and spend monitoring stay visible (locked, with an "Upgrade plan" prompt) instead of disappearing for Developer-plan orgs.
- The LLM Gateway home page now lets you run a hosted model directly or connect a provider key and send a request from your browser, then inspect the response and open the generated trace. After a successful BYOK request, organization admins can add a monthly workspace spend limit through a simplified quickstart flow. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
- The Cost Controls, Rate Limiting, and Model Fallbacks tabs now explain what isn't in force yet, with a create button and a docs link above the policy tables. Each tab's create button, dialog title, and submit button also share one label, such as "Create spend limit" instead of a generic "Create policy". [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
- The LLM Gateway now answers CORS preflight requests and allows cross-origin calls from any origin, so browser-based apps can call it directly instead of proxying through their own backend. Requests are still authenticated from an explicit API key or bearer header, never from cookies.
- Developer-plan orgs using LangChain Gateway Credits can now call hosted models through the unified endpoint (/v1/chat/completions, /v1/messages, /v1/responses, /v1/models), not only the /langchain provider routes.
- The Model Fallbacks tab in LLM Gateway now supports filtering routing configurations by workspace and by fallback trigger status code, making it easier to find the routes that apply to a given workspace or error condition.
- The Gateway home page now shows three shortcut cards highlighting spend controls, model fallbacks, and usage monitoring, tailored to your plan. Developer-tier orgs see them locked with an upgrade prompt.
- Requests to Bedrock models through the unified LLM gateway now use the API format supported by each model family. Anthropic models use Messages, OpenAI models use Responses, and other Bedrock models use Chat Completions, preventing unsupported API errors for models such as Claude Opus.
- The LLM gateway can now reach Amazon Bedrock using an assumed IAM role or AWS access keys instead of a static Bedrock API key, for organizations whose security policy disables API keys. Existing Bedrock API keys retain precedence when multiple credential types are configured. The gateway mints and caches a short-lived Bedrock bearer token per workspace; assumed sessions are bounded by a Bedrock-only session policy and the STS role session name carries the workspace id for CloudTrail attribution.
- The LLM Gateway quickstart now hides the Run request action for workspace members without gateway invocation permission.
- The Gateway page now opens to Usage automatically once your organization has made a Gateway call, so you land on the traffic you care about instead of the setup flow. Getting Started stays one click away for anyone who needs it.
- LLM Gateway responses now include an X-LangSmith-Gateway-Metadata header describing what happened inside the gateway; whether a spend or rate limit blocked the request and at which scope, which route candidates were tried and which model served the request, guard and redaction activity, and upstream error details. Clients can attach it to their own traces as ls_gateway_info metadata to see gateway behavior alongside their LLM runs.
- The Gateway Credits balance card now explains that credits access models hosted by LangChain, and the Gateway home quickstart notes that running a request costs a trace but no additional LangChain fee.
- Running a request against Gateway Credits (hosted models) in the Gateway home quickstart now offers to set a monthly spend limit, matching the Bring Your Own Key flow.
- The three cards at the top of the Gateway home page; Spend limits, Model fallbacks, and Gateway usage; are now static orientation content instead of clickable shortcuts, so they read as a quick summary of what LLM Gateway does rather than navigation.
- The LLM Gateway now returns 424 Failed Dependency instead of a generic 400 Bad Request when a required provider API key is absent from workspace secrets. The error response also identifies the missing secret and explains how to resolve it.
- The LLM Gateway browser quickstart now lets you create a monthly workspace spend limit inline, right where you're recommended one, instead of opening a separate dialog.
- The API key modal launched from Gateway home now defaults to a personal access token and hides the service key, key type, and default workspace fields that don't apply to a new Gateway user. Expiration is capped at 30 days.
- Gateway Credits balance, policy spend, and Gateway Monitoring's spend stats, chart, and table now show `&lt;$0.01` for a positive amount under a cent instead of rounding it down to `$0.00`, so a small amount of spend no longer looks like nothing happened.
- The LLM Gateway now forwards Claude Code Max OAuth credentials for every organization, without requiring a workspace Anthropic API key.
- LLM Gateway spend controls and data protection policies now open in focused side panes, keeping actions visible in the header and warning before unsaved changes are discarded.
- Gateway traces now carry a `gateway.credential_source` metadata field naming the credential that paid for each upstream LLM call (`credits`, `byok`, `subscription_oauth`, or `platform_managed`), allowing you to filter and chart Gateway Credits usage separately from bring-your-own-key usage, plus a `gateway.provider` field naming the provider route that served the call.
- Default gateway spend and rate limits can track and enforce separate buckets for each value of a configured X-Gateway request header.
- LLM Gateway rate-limit creation and policy editing now use focused side panes with unsaved-change warnings. New policies receive descriptive generated names, and optional custom-header conditions are grouped under an advanced section.
- Gateway spend limit forms can configure custom-header buckets, and cost policy tables show which header separates each default limit.
- The LLM Gateway now supports xAI API keys and Grok models through native and unified Responses and Chat Completions endpoints, with tracing and spend attribution. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
- LLM Gateway fallback policies can now route failed provider-model requests through an ordered chain of native provider models and saved model configurations. Configure which HTTP status codes advance to the next candidate, while successful requests continue directly to the original model.
- The Model Fallbacks tab now lets you create and manage automatic fallback chains for provider models. Choose ordered backup models or saved model configurations, select which HTTP errors trigger fallback, and copy a ready-to-use Gateway request example.
- LLM Gateway model fallback policies can now route between providers that use OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, or Anthropic Messages formats. The gateway translates requests, non-streaming responses, and streaming responses for both unified and direct provider endpoints.

## Observability and evaluations

### Datasets and experiments

- Annotation queue tables now label queue contents as items instead of runs, covering both single-run and pairwise queues.
- Datasets whose input, output, or metadata keys contain a colon can now be exported to CSV. This unblocks datasets built from runs with feedback, where feedback is stored under a `source_run_feedback:<key>` metadata key.
- Managed evaluator configuration no longer shows evaluator tracing controls.
- The Datasets & Experiments table now labels dataset names with a Dataset column header, making the relationship between datasets and experiments clearer.

### Monitoring and alerting

- In dashboards and other surfaces where "All time" is unavailable, clearing both dates in the date picker now disables Apply instead of silently submitting an all-time range that fails to load.
- Opening a run from a dashboard chart's runs table now shows a single trace pane instead of stacking a second, identical pane behind the first.

### Automations

- Online evaluators configured with a saved custom provider model configuration (OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible) now use that configuration's endpoint and credentials on live traces instead of failing with a permission error.
- Non-admin users can now save evaluator edits from the dataset, tracing project, and thread panes without hitting a retention-permission error.
- Automations grouped by thread can now add one annotation queue item for each matched conversation, so reviewers can inspect the whole thread instead of only one run.
- Thread webhook and annotation-queue automations now show thread filters instead of run filters, and no longer default to `Is Trace = true`.

### Engine

- The Slack channel list now refreshes in the background even when Slack rate-limits the request, so large workspaces no longer lose picker options.
- Engine fix runs no longer push a branch for every code fix. The commit is parked on a hidden ref and the branch is created when you open a pull request, so connected repositories keep a clean branch list.
- Engine now highlights only Slack notifications in its announcement area and continues to honor prior dismissals.
- Unread Engine issues now show a lighter brand pip aligned to the right of the title, so new issues are easier to scan without competing with the title.

### Tracing

- The Turns view in thread detail is deprecated in favor of the Messages or Details view, and LangSmith Cloud removes it on October 31, 2026, while self-hosted removes it in v17.
- Thread annotation-queue and webhook automations now require SmithDB queries.
- LangSmith Chat now offers GPT-5.6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Terra, and GPT-5.6 Luna alongside the existing OpenAI models.
- LangSmith now recognizes older trace links containing timestamp-prefixed run and trace IDs.
- The tracing quickstart now opens with Deep Agents selected and leads with Deep Agents, LangGraph, and LangChain framework guides.
- Trace details now surface LLM Gateway outcomes, policy limits, selected models, and fallback attempts in a dedicated Gateway section. Errored LLM runs blocked by the gateway also show a Blocked badge in the trace tree.

## Deployment

- LangSmith services now accept both IPv4 and IPv6 connections.
- Deployments now resolve the latest agent server version more reliably, preventing slow revision creation and duplicate revisions caused by request timeouts, especially in Asia Pacific.
- LangSmith workers using Microsoft Entra ID authentication for standalone Redis now start successfully and continue refreshing credentials after the event loop starts.

## Sandboxes

- Mounting a git repository into a sandbox no longer fails silently. Clones now trust the sandbox's certificate bundle, so the repository appears at its mount path instead of starting in an empty directory.
- Sandboxes now retain recent CPU, memory, and network usage history, making it easier to understand resource consumption and diagnose performance bottlenecks.
- WebSocket connections through a sandbox service URL now reach your service with their query string intact. Dev servers that authenticate their own WebSocket with a query parameter, such as Vite's HMR token, now connect instead of failing.

## Administration

- The signup page animation stays aligned with the hero content after the confirmation message appears.
- Users with the tag-on-create permission for datasets, projects, or prompts can now see and apply tags when creating those resources, instead of only workspace managers.
- The API Keys page now filters keys across the full paginated list by key, description, and workspace.
- The organization usage dashboard renders its charts again; they previously could appear blank even when usage data was present, showing only the workspace legend.

### LLM Gateway

- Requests to Bedrock models through the unified LLM Gateway now use the API format supported by each model family. Anthropic models use Messages, OpenAI models use Responses, and other Bedrock models use Chat Completions, preventing unsupported API errors for models such as Claude Opus.
- The LLM Gateway can now reach Amazon Bedrock with an assumed IAM role or AWS access keys instead of a static Bedrock API key, and existing Bedrock API keys still take precedence when multiple credential types are configured.
- The LLM Gateway quickstart now hides the Run request action for workspace members without gateway invocation permission.
- LLM Gateway responses now include an `X-LangSmith-Gateway-Metadata` header describing gateway routing, limits, guard activity, and upstream errors, and clients can attach it to their own traces as `ls_gateway_info` metadata.

</Update>

<Update label="August 3-10, 2026" rss={{ title: "2026-08-03 - LangSmith Cloud update" }}>

## Access control

- Access-policy endpoints now report errors as RFC 7807 problem details. Error messages move from the `error` field to `detail`, and semantically invalid request bodies return HTTP 422.
- Set a resource tag key or value description to `null` to clear it through the PATCH API.
- New connections to the hosted LangSmith MCP server failed to register when the client requested a confidential authentication method. Dynamic client registration now issues a public client in that case instead of returning an error, so connecting from Claude and other MCP clients works again.
- Role permission and access policy changes now invalidate cached authorization results reliably, including when an older transaction commits after a newer update.
- LangSmith now refreshes cached role access policies as soon as their permissions change, preventing stale authorization decisions in split-plane deployments.
- The Active, Pending, and Deactivated tabs on the Members settings page now switch on the first click while keeping pagination and sorting in sync.

## Datasets and experiments

- Attachment and object downloads now always declare how the browser should handle the response. Files whose type is unrecognized, or that were stored without a type, are delivered as downloads instead of being rendered in the page.
- Creating a dataset from the Datasets or Home empty state now opens the new dataset instead of briefly showing a Page not found screen.
- Dataset JSON schema descriptions are now safely rendered in editor tooltips.
- Creating or validating an example with a `dataset_id` that is not a well-formed UUID now returns a 422 naming the field instead of a 500.
- Listing or counting examples with an unsupported `filter` expression, an unfilterable attribute, or a `has(...)` comparison whose value is not valid JSON, now returns a 422 naming the `filter` parameter instead of a 500.
- Creating an experiment no longer converts an existing tracing project with the same name. Rename the experiment or choose a new project name when a conflict exists.
- Scrolling through large experiment comparison results no longer re-fetches the first page of examples on every lazy-load, cutting redundant network traffic and reducing load time.

## Monitoring and alerting

- Chart headers on dashboards no longer overflow or wrap when the title or description is long, the description now truncates with a hover tooltip that reveals the full text. The expand-chart action also picks up the standard icon-button hover treatment.
- Alert previews now treat integer metadata and its string representation consistently with alert evaluation.

## Engine

- Disabling Engine for an organization or pausing it for a project now offers a short prompt asking why, with an optional comment. It takes one tap and goes straight to the team building Engine.
- Engine spend controls now explain that new runs pause at the monthly limit while runs already in progress may finish and increase billed spend beyond it.
- The Engine tab is visible again on tracing projects before Engine is turned on, so admins can enable it, members can request access, and personal organizations can upgrade, all from the tab itself.
- Engine GitHub settings now link to setup instructions for LangSmith Cloud and self-hosted deployments, with clearer guidance when a connection fails.
- Engine scans on non-coding-agent boards apply the configured priority chips, user instructions, and trace-scope filter instead of reviewing the whole project.
- Engine issue descriptions now preserve Markdown paragraph boundaries so updates, additional symptoms, and corrections remain easy to scan.

## Feedback and evaluation

- Feedback corrections can now reset a score to its original value, including zero.
- Group by metadata and metadata columns are selectable again in the experiment comparison view.
- A long evaluator name in a feedback card's Source row now truncates instead of extending past the card, and a corrected score keeps its edit control clear of the paging arrows when a key has several entries.
- Switching a feedback value to a different category now saves even when both categories map to the same numeric score. Previously the change was silently dropped on run details and in annotation queue rubrics.
- The pencil for correcting an evaluator score is now hidden unless you have permission to update feedback. Previously it appeared for anyone who could see the score, and saving the correction failed.
- LangSmith now rejects credential-bearing and non-GitHub remote URLs when rendering evaluation commit links.
- Attachments stored on a run now appear when you review it in an annotation queue, including pairwise queues. Previously only media inlined in the run's inputs or outputs was shown.
- The evaluator spend table keeps the All runs filter badge inactive when an evaluator has no filters.
- Daily evaluator spend, weekly totals, and spend limit monitoring on the Evaluators page now respect the currently selected application, instead of showing data across all applications.
- The evaluator spend chart once again keeps its evaluator and project/dataset grouping control in the chart header for easier access.

## Tracing and observability

- Chat model runs sent through the gateway's unified endpoint with provider/model slugs now match model pricing rules, producing accurate trace costs.
- Insights reports only analyze traces, so the "Is Trace" condition in a report's filter is now fixed. Setting it to false previously produced a report that ran successfully but never found any insights.
- LangSmith Chat now respects the Provider API setting on workspace OpenAI model configurations. Models configured for the Responses API no longer fall back to Chat Completions, which made newer reasoning models fail when a reasoning effort was set.
- Large PDF, JSON, and CSV previews on a message now render instead of showing an empty frame, and PDF and JSON previews gained an open-in-new-tab control next to the expand control.
- Trace views now source token and feedback stats from SmithDB without attempting unavailable ClickHouse queries.
- Waterfall filters in thread details now keep deeply nested matches visible and preserve filter controls while newly ingested traces are still appearing.
- LangSmith MCP's `fetch_runs` tool can now include invocation parameters, including the tool and function schemas sent to an LLM, for easier tool-calling diagnosis.
- PDF attachment icons now align consistently with other file types in attachment lists.
- The thread query API now supports trace, run-tree, and thread-level filter expressions through `trace_filter`, `tree_filter`, and `thread_filter`.
- Public shared-trace links now show a 'temporarily unavailable, try again' message when the trace query times out, instead of the misleading 'trace not found, ask the owner to re-share' message.
- Clicking a starter prompt without the selected model's API key configured now shows the add-a-key form, the same as typing a message, instead of failing the request.

## Prompts and playground

- Claude models on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform now load successfully in the Playground when no credentials secret is configured, matching existing Gemini behavior under GCP Workload Identity or AWS IRSA.
- The Prompts page now supports filtering by prompt type, prompt tags, and commit tags, so you can quickly narrow the list down to the prompts you're looking for.
- Model configurations now show an inline error, instead of a silent save, when a required Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, or Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform provider field is left blank.
- Studio's chat pane no longer shows a 'No data' placeholder between sending a message and the first streamed token. The assistant message now appears once it has content to show.
- The Playground now reports missing AWS credentials and other Bedrock rejections as request errors with the provider's own message, instead of a generic server error.
- Studio chat now shows elapsed response status, preserves complete streamed responses, and follows new output without interrupting readers who scroll up.

## Automations

- Manually triggering an automation rule through the API now works. `POST /runs/rules/{rule_id}/trigger` and the `rule_ids` form of `POST /runs/rules/trigger` previously returned a 500 for every request.
- You can manually trigger any automation in your workspace, including webhook-only, alert-only, and extend-retention rules. Previously the trigger endpoint only recognized a subset of actions and returned not found for the rest.
- Online evaluators configured with an OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible custom endpoint now use that endpoint's own URL and API key on live traces instead of failing with an authentication error. Evaluators on custom endpoints are not counted toward evaluator spend limits.

## Deployment

- Self-hosted deployment forms now support Redis CPU and memory requests and limits. The configured values are applied to the Redis workload managed by the Kubernetes operator.
- Deployments that use a platform-default LangGraph API version now correctly reuse matching images instead of starting unnecessary rebuilds.
- Managed Deep Agent deployments entering public preview report their normal deployment usage.
- Rolling back a deployment that was created from an uploaded source archive now redeploys that revision's archive instead of the most recent one.
- A Managed Deep Agent deployment's Details sidebar now links to the Context Hub repo holding its deployed instructions, skills, and memories. Archived repos are labelled so it is clear when the context is no longer live.

## Sandboxes

- Resuming a suspended sandbox now checks your organization's real sandbox quota, including plan-specific limits, instead of the default cap. Requests that genuinely exceed quota return 429 with a quota message rather than 502 Bad Gateway.
- Self-hosted LangSmith now enables sandbox API and UI access only when the deployment license includes sandbox access.
- Online self-hosted LangSmith installations now report finalized sandbox uptime and resource usage for billing when phone-home usage reporting is enabled. Offline and opted-out installations do not send sandbox usage.

## Administration

- The organization submenu now opens when you hover over the organization row in the footer menu.
- Self-hosted deployments refresh their license every 5 minutes instead of every 24 hours, so entitlement changes take effect shortly after they are made. A failed refresh no longer restarts the service, it keeps using the last verified license until that license's own expiry. The tuning knob is now LICENSE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS (default 300), replacing LICENSE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_HOURS.
- Searching workspaces with Cmd+K now highlights the query in the organization heading, making it clear why a term that matches an organization name returns all of that organization's workspaces.
- The account menu now offers Get help. Enterprise users can submit a support request in LangSmith, while other cloud users are directed to the Support Portal.
- The Plans and pricing page now preserves browser back and forward trackpad gestures and centers the plan cards.

## LLM Gateway

- Requests to moonshotai/kimi-k3 and moonshotai/kimi-k2.6 through gateway credit models in the LLM gateway are now matched against a price map when sent in user-traced code.
- LLM Gateway Usage now provides interactive spend legends, consistent chart layouts, and tooltips that stay visible. Single-series views clearly explain spend that is not affiliated with a user instead of showing an empty chart.
- You can now purchase as little as $4.50 in Gateway Credits, equivalent to 3 LCUs.
- Bedrock requests through the LLM gateway now use the Amazon Bedrock price map so their costs are calculated correctly.
- The credit balance now shows above the connect card, and the shortcut cards for cost controls, model fallbacks, and spend monitoring stay visible (locked, with an "Upgrade plan" prompt) instead of disappearing for Developer-plan orgs.
- The Cost Controls, Rate Limiting, and Model Fallbacks tabs now explain what isn't in force yet, with a create button and a docs link above the policy tables. Each tab's create button, dialog title, and submit button also share one label, such as "Create spend limit" instead of a generic "Create policy".

</Update>

<Update label="July 27-31, 2026" rss={{ title: "2026-07-27 - LangSmith Cloud update" }}>

## Observability and evaluations

### Datasets and experiments

- LangSmith exposes annotation queue item endpoints for adding, listing, updating, deleting, counting, positioning, and reviewing run or thread queue items through the public API and SDK generation flow.
- Uploading a .csv or .jsonl dataset now works regardless of the Content-Type the browser reports. Windows browsers label .csv files as an Excel type, which previously caused valid uploads to fail. Uppercase filenames such as DATASET.CSV are also accepted.
- Evaluator lists on a dataset or tracing project now show an evaluator's current name instead of the name it had when it was attached. Feedback keys are unchanged by a rename.
- Metadata columns in the experiment comparison grid, including `example.metadata.<key>`, now render their values instead of staying empty.
- LangSmith marks every legacy endpoint replaced by the SmithDB SDK migration guide as deprecated: the v1 runs query and retrieve endpoints, the v1 run sharing and public-run read endpoints, `POST /api/v1/datasets/{dataset_id}/runs`, and the annotation queue run endpoints. All of them now respond with `Deprecation: true`, a `Sunset` date of January 31, 2027, and a `Link` header pointing at the migration guide and, where a single replacement exists, the successor endpoint. [Learn more](/langsmith/smithdb-sdk-migration).
- Dataset experiment tables can sort by feedback score when SmithDB queries are enabled and ClickHouse queries are disabled.
- Annotation queue item APIs use project_id for the tracing project. Request bodies also accept session_id as an alias.
- Dataset example views restore clear spacing between the example details and tab navigation.
- Pairwise annotation queue runs again include the tracing project id needed to create feedback when ClickHouse query support is disabled.
- Correcting an evaluator score from the experiment results grid now updates the cell and its popover right away instead of requiring a page refresh.
- The Configure Evaluator pane's header and templates navigation again paint the same background as the pane itself in dark mode.
- Dataset and run attachments now resolve relative signed download URLs before previewing, opening, or downloading them in self-hosted deployments.

### Monitoring and alerting

- Adds a reusable ChartCard component to the LangSmith design system, standardizing chart titles, move, expand, and overflow actions, responsive full-width layouts, and chart and legend spacing.

### Engine

- A resolved issue on an Engine Issue Board now returns to Open as soon as Engine links a new matching trace to it. Previously the trace was filed as evidence but the issue stayed closed, so a problem that came back never resurfaced on the board. Dismissed issues stay dismissed.
- The issue detail header now renders category and tag badges on the same line as the title instead of stacking them underneath, tightening the header and reducing wasted vertical space.
- The "Engine failed to complete a run" trigger is no longer offered when configuring a Slack channel or webhook destination on an issue board. Destinations already subscribed to it keep receiving those notifications.
- Engine run webhooks and sandbox links now resolve the externally reachable API base from LANGSMITH_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT, falling back to LANGCHAIN_PLATFORM_ENDPOINT and then LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT. Installs whose chart set only LANGSMITH_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT were building relative URLs, which made every non-shadow Engine run fail because the run webhook was rejected as a loopback address.

### Tracing

- Trace detail panes once again use an elevated background that matches their section headers.
- Bulk exports accept a new opt-in `feedbacks` column that carries each run's individual feedback entries, with their key and comment, as a JSON array. Add `feedbacks` to `export_fields` when creating an export; exports that omit `export_fields` keep their existing columns.
- Delete an entire trace from the run details actions menu after confirming the destructive action.
- Negative feedback-key filters now return matching traces correctly when ClickHouse uses optimized runs tables.
- When a project configures a custom output renderer, the trace Output section now offers it as a Custom option alongside Markdown, Plain, JSON, and YAML instead of replacing them. Custom stays the default, and your choice is remembered.
- Tracing project activity and sorting stay up to date for self-hosted deployments using Redis versions before 6.2.
- `POST /api/v1/runs/stats` now returns a 404 when the requested tracing project does not exist in your workspace, and reports other client errors, such as a `start_time` older than the supported lookback window, with their real status and message instead of a generic 500 internal server error.
- Self-hosted deployments now catch up missing tracing project last-run timestamps so project sorting reflects recent historical activity.
- Run filters now support total, prompt, and completion token counts and costs consistently across routed query backends.
- Token Count / Cost filters now default to total tokens / cost instead of input tokens. Input and output token / cost breakdowns remain available in the selector.
- On a tracing project, resetting a view now moves the Threads/Traces/Runs switcher back in step with the rows being shown. Previously the switcher could stay on Runs while the table had already returned to traces.

### Feedback

- The annotation queue item endpoints are now documented at their served path under /api/v1/platform, so the generated SDK methods for listing, adding, updating, counting, deleting, and placing queue items reach the API instead of returning 404.
- PDFs and other documents attached to a message now render in a full-width preview frame with a header control that opens them nearly full screen, instead of collapsing to a thumbnail-sized box.

### Prompts and playground

- When a model provider rejects a playground run, such as a wrong API key or an exhausted quota, the playground now shows the provider's own error message instead of a generic server error, so the cause is clear from the error itself.
- Playground batch and invoke endpoints now sanitize buffered run trees into JSON-safe payloads before responding, so online evaluations no longer fail with opaque 500s when a run graph cannot be serialized.

### Automations

- Forking an evaluator attaches the copy to the project or dataset named in the fork dialog. Previously the copy could be created attached to nothing, leaving the original evaluator running the version you had just edited away from.

## Deployment

- The Create New Deployment form now shows a clear, per-field message when a submitted value fails validation (e.g. an invalid image path) instead of the raw backend error payload.
- Deleting a tracing project whose LangGraph deployment is still within its post-deletion retention window now schedules the project to be removed along with the deployment, and explains that in the error message instead of asking you to delete a deployment you already deleted.
- The delete confirmation for a LangGraph deployment now says that cleanup of the underlying database runs after you confirm, and that a deleted deployment's name stays reserved until that cleanup finishes.

## Sandboxes

- Sandboxes accept a new streaming execute request that returns stdout and stderr as Server-Sent Events, for clients that cannot hold a WebSocket. Passing a command ID reuses a running command, and a separate resume request continues an interrupted stream instead of running the command again.
- Sandboxes now ship with the `langsmith` CLI on PATH, so agents can query traces, runs, and datasets without installing it first.
- Sandbox and snapshot rows now use single-column layouts with actions in context menus, snapshot sources remain available in their menus, and wrapped names stay left-aligned.
- Engine sandbox commands in self-hosted deployments now authenticate over WebSocket with the deployment service key, preventing 401 failures after successful sandbox creation.
- The `langsmith` CLI in sandboxes is updated to v0.2.44. Its requests now resolve on self-hosted deployments that serve the API under `/api`, where commands such as `trace messages` and the project issues commands previously failed.

## Administration

- The LangSmith home page now provides quick access to copy the current organization and workspace IDs.
- On self-hosted installations authenticating with OAuth/SSO, the Remote MCP authorization endpoint returned a 400 because the SSO login route shadowed it. OAuth clients can now complete the authorize step and connect to the Remote MCP server.
- Self-hosted deployments with an online license key (beacon access) now see the monthly organization usage graph automatically, without needing the enable_monthly_usage_charts org config. Offline deployments are now pointed to the Granular usage tab for locally-recorded billable usage.
- Switching workspaces or organizations keeps you on the same page when the route has no workspace-specific resource IDs. Routes that reference a specific resource continue to open the destination workspace home page.
- LangSmith now refreshes expired browser sessions and retries interrupted API requests before asking you to log in again.

### LLM Gateway

- Gateway policies with a blank or whitespace-only name now fall back to showing the policy ID instead of rendering an empty name cell, and the policy update endpoint now rejects blank names the same way creation already does.
- The Gateway usage spend chart now shows the top 12 individual spenders per bucket, rolling the rest into an "Other" series, and its hover tooltip lists every contributor at once with the bucket total pinned beneath them.
- The home page onboarding flow now includes a step for choosing how your agent reaches a model: bring your own provider API key, or use Gateway Credits. Choosing Gateway Credits lets an organization admin pre-purchase prepaid credit and shows the API key and gateway URL needed to start sending traffic, with no provider account required.
- The custom X-Gateway-* header condition on LLM Gateway spend-cap and rate-limit policies now works with organization-, workspace-, and user-scoped policies too, not just API-key-scoped ones, so you can split a single subject's traffic into separate caps by header value regardless of how the policy is scoped.
- Default spend cap and rate limit policies in LLM Gateway now expand to show the per-user, per-workspace, and per-API-key policies materialized underneath them.
- The Gateway Credits purchase dialog now shows the credit balance your purchase will land you on, and states the fee-inclusive total directly above a single purchase button. Large amounts no longer push the credits readout and total outside the dialog.
- Enterprise organizations without Data Protection now see the tab in the LLM Gateway, greyed out with a link to request access, instead of the tab being hidden entirely.
- The connect card now appears above the Gateway Credits balance on the LLM Gateway Home page, and the generated code snippets list the API key before the base URL to match common convention.
- Generating an API key from the LLM Gateway Home connect card now shows the standard one-time key reveal dialog, and each provider's "Configured" status now reflects the workspace's actual secrets instead of a fixed list.
- The "Purchase Credits" button on LLM Gateway Home now opens the credit purchase dialog instead of showing a "coming soon" message, and the balance bar now shows spend against what's actually purchased instead of against the plan's purchase limit.
- The Cost Controls and Model Fallbacks shortcuts on LLM Gateway Home now read "View cost controls"/"View model fallbacks" for members who can't manage the org, instead of "Manage"/"Configure".
- Gateway Home code samples now use the gateway hostname constructed for each LangSmith region and default to the Responses API where supported. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
- LLM Gateway policy tabs now clarify that policies apply across the organization, while Usage clarifies that spend is scoped to the selected workspace.
- The home onboarding step now states your Gateway Credits balance in US dollars, matching the amount you purchase, instead of converting it to LCUs.
- The prompt you copy into your coding agent during onboarding now states how the agent should reach a model, based on the provider you picked: Gateway Credits, or your own provider API key.
- Homepage spacing and surface tinting now match design review feedback, and several small copy fixes clarify credit limits, provider status, and organization-level purchase limits.
- LLM Gateway Home again includes Google Gemini and generates valid model identifiers for Gemini and Baseten connect samples. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
- LLM Gateway Home now highlights the selected model and lets you switch connect samples between Chat Completions, Messages, and Responses formats.
- The LLM Gateway Usage tab now explains when usage queries aren't available for a deployment instead of showing failed dashboard requests.
- When you select Gateway Credits during onboarding, the prompt copied into your coding agent now includes the correct Gateway URL for your deployment. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).
- Gateway Credits checkout now remains on the active purchase step while a free workspace upgrades to the Developer plan, instead of briefly showing the saved-card view before closing.
- Requests that set prompt_cache_options (or the deprecated prompt_cache_retention) now enable Anthropic prompt caching when the LLM Gateway translates an OpenAI Chat Completions or Responses request to a Claude model, instead of ignoring the field. Anthropic's default cache lifetime applies, and prompt_cache_key, prompt_cache_retention, and prompt_cache_options are all preserved when translating between the Chat Completions and Responses formats.
- Tooltips on disabled LLM Gateway policy controls now read "You need organization admin access to create policies" instead of referencing the raw organization:manage permission string.
- The Gateway Usage tab no longer shows an in-page workspace dropdown. The page is already scoped to your current workspace, and its subtitle now names that workspace directly.

## Observability and evaluations

### Datasets and experiments

- `GET /annotation-queues/{id}/items` now returns THREAD queue items alongside RUN items, with an optional item_type filter. THREAD list rows expose identity on the item (thread_id/session_id/start_time) and omit nested thread; RUN list still hydrates nested run for now (same omit planned for metadata-only list). Traces and messages load via the v2 threads APIs when reviewing.
- `GET /annotation-queues/{id}/runs` and related size endpoints exclude THREAD queue rows (run_id is null) so mixed queues no longer return 500. Use GET /items for thread listing.
- Project settings now require a thread idle time of at least two minutes to ensure thread evaluations include all ingested runs.
- Annotation queue item add requests now consistently enforce a 100-item limit for runs and threads. Over-limit errors clearly show the configured limit.
- `GET /annotation-queues/{id}/items` returns Postgres membership metadata for RUN and THREAD items without hydrating nested run or thread payloads from ClickHouse or SmithDB. Orphan queue rows remain listed. The include_stats query parameter is removed. Annotate payloads load via get-one / review APIs.
- When you bulk-add runs from a tracing project, its default dataset now appears first in the dataset picker.
- Annotation queue review lists now label unnamed run rows as `Run <ID>`, matching thread rows and making mixed queues easier to scan.
- Opening the pairwise experiment comparison from a pairwise annotation queue no longer crashes the page when both compared runs come from the same experiment.

### Tracing

- The Insights reports pane can now be collapsed to give report details more space.
- Insights cluster summary columns can now expand to show more of each summary.
- LangSmith MCP's `fetch_runs` tool now returns `first_token_time` when that value is recorded for fetched runs, making TTFT analysis available without a separate SDK query.
- Legacy run URLs now resolve the run metadata and redirect to the SmithDB trace view instead of showing an error.
- Trace usage limit banners now appear only for workspace members whose user-scoped limit has been exceeded.
- The Deployment button on tracing project pages now opens the deployment page within the app instead of reloading the UI.
- Clicking the already-selected run or trace in a thread's trace tree now keeps it selected instead of deselecting it and scrolling back to the first trace.
- Fixed two frontend call sites that could reach POST /runs/stats with an empty or missing session, preventing spurious 422 errors in the Insights job config and session rules form.
- MCP run query tools now return gateway timeout responses without retrying, reducing duplicate load when a run query times out.
- Pressing Enter to confirm characters from an input method editor (e.g. Pinyin for Chinese, or Japanese/Korean IMEs) in LangSmith Chat now commits the composed text instead of prematurely sending the message.
- LangSmith Chat now surfaces a run's system prompt inline when reading a traced LLM run, so it can explain why a model behaved a certain way without missing the system prompt. It also recognizes system prompts stored as provider-level fields (OpenAI Responses `instructions`, Anthropic `system`).
- LangSmith Chat traces now show the model you configured instead of mislabeling it as GPT-3.5-Turbo when a custom model endpoint is used.
- The Run in Studio button is now hidden on public (shared) run pages, where it previously pointed to an authenticated page that shared viewers cannot open.
- Navigating between traces now clears stale sharing state, so unshared traces no longer appear public.
- The run, trace, and thread detail panels now enforce a minimum width when resized, so their header no longer overflows and forces the view to scroll sideways.
- Restore `is_in_dataset` on trace and run responses when the query is proxied to the V1 backend in ClickHouse-only mode. The V1 select now forwards `in_dataset` so the Python backend computes it and the proxy renames it back to `is_in_dataset` for V2 callers.
- BYOC workspaces now avoid requesting trace table fields that older data planes do not support, preventing invalid request errors when viewing traces.
- Custom dashboard charts can now query summed latency and first-token time metrics through the runs analytics SmithDB path.
- Custom dashboard charts can now query minimum and maximum latency, time-to-first-token, token, and cost values through SmithDB-backed runs analytics.
- Custom dashboard charts can now query P90 and P95 for latency, first token time, tokens, and cost metrics, in addition to the existing P50 and P99.
- Custom dashboard charts can now aggregate feedback scores by sum, P50, P90, P95, and P99, in addition to the existing average, min, and max.
- The LangSmith homepage now provides clearer onboarding steps for coding agents and tracing, including a direct shortcut for creating a tracing project.

### Prompts and playground

- Editing agent and skill metadata in the Context Hub now shows save progress, reports actionable errors without discarding changes, and displays successful updates immediately.
- Prompts with a repo readme now display it in a dedicated Readme section of the prompt view.
- Gemini 3.6 Flash and Gemini 3.5 Flash Lite are now available in Fleet, Agent Builder, and playground model selectors, with usage pricing support.
- Pasting content into rich-text editors, such as the prompt playground and agent chat, now works reliably again.
- Previewing a single dataset row after running a full experiment now resolves the row's evaluator scores instead of showing a feedback cell that loads indefinitely, and the resulting feedback chips render with their proper colors.
- LangSmith no longer keeps system-added top_p values when switching OpenAI prompts to reasoning models, preventing invalid invocation parameters. Users who still need top_p can add it as an extra model parameter for supported non-reasoning models.

### Engine

- The organization Engine usage page now lets you switch between a workspaces view and a projects view of month-to-date LCU spend, each ranked by spend. The Engine spend API returns the authoritative total independently of the breakdown.
- Engine no longer shows redundant hover tooltips on issue category badges or the default Fix action. Permission and PR status explanations still appear when they add context.
- Engine opens the Slack or webhook destination form immediately when no destinations are configured.
- Engine issue category labels now appear on a dedicated row below the title for more consistent spacing and readability.
- Engine now shows a warning beside a linked repository when it cannot access it, including failures caused by renamed or deleted repositories and broken GitHub connections.
- On an Engine issue, navigating to the next or previous linked trace now stays in the conversation view for traces that belong to a thread, instead of switching to the single-trace view.
- Engine now shows a clickable Paused status in the issues header when scheduled scanning is paused, so you can see its status and open settings directly.
- Engine now works in supported self-hosted deployments without Eppo rollout configuration, while organization enablement and existing permissions remain enforced.
- Opening the project spend limit from the pause confirmation now scrolls the settings pane to the limit editor.
- Engine Overview now displays the current Engine package version so you can see when the underlying experience changes.

### Monitoring and alerting

- Self-hosted alert webhook delivery now honors `SSRF_ALLOW_K8S_INTERNAL`, so internal Kubernetes service hostnames can be used when that setting is enabled. Metadata endpoints, localhost, and private IP protections remain controlled by their existing SSRF policy settings.

### Automations

- Thread (grouped) evaluators now require a minimum idle time of 120 seconds. Setting a project's thread idle time below 120s is rejected.
- Leaving feedback on a run in a thread now makes the thread eligible for re-evaluation, so thread-level evaluators re-run when new feedback arrives.
- Editing an online evaluator (LLM-as-judge or custom code) no longer intermittently fails when sandbox validation is slow.

## Deployment

- Worker and API server CPU charts now plot a peak (max) series alongside the average, so a single replica with high CPU usage is no longer hidden by the fleet-wide average.
- Worker and API server memory charts now plot a peak (max) series alongside the average, so a single replica approaching its memory limit is no longer hidden by the fleet-wide average.
- Creating a deployment with a name that's already in use within your workspace now returns a 409 Conflict instead of a 500 error.
- Hybrid deployments remain compatible with older listeners during control-plane upgrades, preventing new deployments from remaining queued.

## Sandboxes

- A sandbox proxy configuration can now define environment variables that are applied to every command in the sandbox. This is handy when a tool refuses to run unless a credential env var is present (for example gh needs GH_TOKEN) even though the egress proxy injects the real credential on the wire. Set a placeholder value so the command starts.
- Attach free-form key/value labels when creating a sandbox or snapshot. Labels are stored and returned on reads; sandboxes inherit their snapshot's labels, and snapshots built from a Docker image inherit the image's labels.
- Sandbox network egress now tries every resolved IP for a destination instead of only the first, so requests to multi-homed hosts (for example apt package mirrors) no longer fail when the first address is unreachable on the requested port.
- Creating a sandbox with only mem_bytes set now derives a matching CPU allocation automatically, so requests for larger-memory sandboxes no longer need an explicit vcpus value to satisfy the CPU-to-memory ratio.

## Administration

- Selecting All Workspaces on the Granular Billable Usage page now loads usage successfully for organizations with many workspaces.
- The Granular Usage page now shows a notice that long-lived trace usage isn't tracked in self-hosted deployments, so the "Long-lived only" filter is expected to show zero results there.

### LLM Gateway

- Gateway Monitoring now shows spend for the workspace you're viewing rather than the whole organization, with a dropdown to switch workspaces from the page. Spend cards show N/A instead of a repeated error message when a workspace's gateway project can't be resolved.
- The Rate Limiting tab in Gateway Policies now supports creating, editing, deleting, and enabling/disabling request- and token-based rate-limit policies, alongside the existing cost-control and data-protection policy management.
- Editing a materialized LLM Gateway policy now turns it into a standalone override, preventing later default policy changes from overwriting its custom limits.
- You can now call LangChain-managed models through the LLM gateway without configuring your own provider credentials. Usage is metered at cost and bounded by a monthly spend cap based on your plan; once the cap is reached, further requests are blocked until the next month. The cap can be raised on request. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway-langchain-provider).
- Selecting an entity filter on the LLM Gateway spend monitoring page no longer flips the breakdown to a different dimension.
- Selecting more than one entity in any Gateway Monitoring breakdown filter (model, user, or API key) now returns spend for all chosen entities instead of no data.
- The Gateway Monitoring spend chart now formats axis labels and tooltip ranges in UTC to match its UTC-anchored buckets, so viewers in non-UTC timezones no longer see off-by-one dates.
- The LLM Gateway spend chart and table now label spend from service keys as "Unaffiliated with any user" instead of showing a blank name, with a tooltip explaining that the spend came from a workspace/org-scoped key rather than an individual.
- API-key-scoped LLM Gateway spend-cap and rate-limit policies can now add a custom X-Gateway-* header condition, so a single API key can match different limits per header value. For example, a reseller can set separate caps per downstream customer without distributing multiple keys.
- Stat card and table headers in the LLM Gateway monitoring page's Spend tab (e.g. "Total Spend", "Daily Avg", "API Key") now capitalize every word, matching the header style used elsewhere in the product.
- When a specific start/end date is selected in the LLM Gateway monitoring page's date range picker, the button now shows the dates in UTC and appends "(UTC)" so it's clear the range doesn't follow your local timezone. Relative ranges like "Last 7 days" are unaffected.
- The "Spend share" column on the LLM Gateway Monitoring spend dashboard no longer cuts off its header text.
- The LLM Gateway now lives in a dedicated top-level sidebar section instead of under Settings, with a new Home tab listing your custom model configurations and a ready-to-run code snippet for the gateway. Old Settings gateway links redirect automatically.
- A Home banner for LangSmith Cloud orgs with LLM Gateway enabled highlights how Gateway manages costs and improves runtime reliability. [Learn more](/langsmith/llm-gateway).

<Update label="July 13-17, 2026" rss={{ title: "2026-07-13 - LangSmith Cloud update" }}>

## Observability and evaluations

### Datasets and experiments

- The legacy feedback formula endpoints (`POST/GET /feedback/formulas` and `GET/PUT/DELETE /feedback/formulas/{feedback_formula_id}`) that back composite scores are deprecated in favor of [composite evaluators](/langsmith/composite-evaluators-ui), which implement a composite score as a code evaluator plus a run rule, and are scheduled for removal on 2026-08-20. Migrate existing feedback formulas to the new composite model.
- Model, prompt, and tool chips in the Experiments table config cells now lay out from real measurements for accurate truncation, and the +N overflow badge is a clickable dropdown whose entries expose the same actions (filter, group by, open in playground, and details) as a chip's own menu.
- Expanding the run tree for repetition runs in [experiment comparison](/langsmith/compare-experiment-results) views now works reliably when a repetition root has a project ID but no session ID.
- [Evaluators](/langsmith/evaluators) linked to Hub prompts now load correctly for flat and playground-shaped prompt commits, fixing crashes when editing existing evaluators.
- Code evaluator upload now accepts Python entrypoints annotated with PEP 604 union return types (for example `-> dict | None`).
- POST /v2/datasets/{dataset_id}/experiment-runs is the supported public API for paginated experiment comparison. Legacy dataset comparison helpers are removed from the public OpenAPI spec and generated SDKs; existing HTTP routes continue to work for LangSmith UI clients.
- Each example's dataset splits now render as chips in the dataset Examples table, laid out from real measurements with a clickable +N overflow menu when an example belongs to more splits than fit the column.
- Adds `langsmith evaluator create-llm` to define structured LLM-as-judge evaluator rules from a prompt, schema, and model config file, targeting a project or dataset.
- The experiment comparison view now offers an optional, reorderable "Splits (latest)" column that shows each example's current dataset split assignments as chips, reflecting live membership rather than the as-of-run snapshot.
- Evaluator spend charts on project and dataset evaluator tabs keep their desktop layout on narrow screens and scroll horizontally instead of compressing the chart and stat cards.
- The experiment comparison and group-by views now show each example's current dataset split rather than the split it had when the experiment ran, so you can tell whether failures already belong to a split without re-running the experiment.
- Comparison view now loads token and cost stats from SmithDB for root runs, so the stats columns populate again instead of staying blank
- LangSmith now caps reusable [evaluators](/langsmith/evaluators) per workspace to prevent unbounded resource growth. Contact support if your workspace needs a higher limit.
- Creating [dataset examples](/langsmith/manage-datasets) from [source runs](/langsmith/manage-datasets) now correctly fetches run inputs and outputs backed by SmithDB, and no longer fails the whole request if one of several source runs can't be found.
- Select multiple rows in an experiment (or select all matching the current filters) and add, replace, or remove their dataset splits in one action, or copy the selected examples to another dataset, instead of editing rows one at a time.
- The `/runs/rules/validate` endpoint now supports [thread evaluators](/langsmith/online-evaluations-multi-turn). Pass `test_thread_id` and `session_id` to test a multi-turn evaluator against a real conversation before saving.
- Custom code evaluators that time out or fail on a run now record an error on that run instead of silently leaving it without feedback, so partial evaluation failures are visible on the experiment.
- The Open source run action on an example page now reads session and start time from dedicated example fields populated at creation, enabling reliable navigation to the source trace on SmithDB.
- The thread evaluator config preview now shows the thread message formats the evaluator actually maps, instead of listing every available format.
- Multi-turn evaluators now include a Test action that runs the evaluator against a sample thread before you save the rule.
- The evaluator config now shows a locked "Trace count ≥ 2" filter for managed thread evaluators, making it clear they only run on threads with multiple turns.
- Experiment comparison and individual experiment views now load run rows on self-hosted deployments that authenticate the UI via SSO/OAuth session cookies. Previously these views could show 'No results found' even though metrics and feedback loaded.
- Experiment statistics now refresh promptly for recently run experiments while keeping historical experiment scans bounded.
- The Assertions evaluator added via "Add evaluator" now reads assertions from the reference output like the auto-attached version, so it grades against the real assertions instead of always failing.
- Evaluator spend chart y-axes now abbreviate amounts of $1,000 or more, making high-spend values easier to scan.
- Exporting a dataset comparison view as CSV now returns a clear "file is too large to export" error instead of a generic server error when the export exceeds internal size limits.
- Each split chip in a row's Splits cell is now interactive in the experiment results and comparison views, with an Edit splits action that opens the single-example split picker so you can reassign splits without leaving the table.
- Add RUN items to a single [annotation queue](/langsmith/annotation-queues) with POST /annotation-queues/{queue_id}/items. The server resolves runs via ClickHouse or SmithDB and returns a standards-shaped items envelope; THREAD support follows in a later release.
- The LangSmith CLI now updates existing code evaluator rules in place when `evaluator upload --replace` is used, avoiding a delete-before-create window if the replacement upload fails.
- Split the read datasets into a new download datasets permission.  Enforce this new permission in both the application and in APIs.  The download button is disabled for those users without the download permission. [Learn more](/langsmith/organization-workspace-operations#datasets).
- Public dataset experiment traces open correctly when experiment runs provide their project identifier through the v2 response shape.
- A run rule with a 0 sampling rate processes no runs, but the scheduler still enumerated it every tick. The scheduler query now skips rules with sampling_rate 0 (parity with the is_enabled check), so they are never dispatched.
- Dataset and experiment tables now truncate long input and reference-output text and show detected base64 images as small thumbnails with a delayed larger preview, avoiding oversized hidden DOM content.
- Experiment tables now defer full payload rendering and output diff preparation until those views are requested, improving responsiveness for runs with large agent trajectories.
- Public dataset share links now resolve the sessions list (with stats) from SmithDB when ClickHouse querying is disabled, so shared dataset pages no longer fail to load on SmithDB-only deployments.
- Add conversation threads to a single [annotation queue](/langsmith/annotation-queues) with POST /annotation-queues/{queue_id}/items using item_type THREAD (thread_id + session_id). Mixed RUN and THREAD batches are supported; the server resolves threads via ClickHouse or SmithDB.
- Code evaluators now get more time to run each batch, so evaluators that import heavy libraries like scikit-learn are less likely to time out.
- POST /annotation-queues/{queue_id}/items now accepts at most 200 items per request and returns a clear validation error when the limit is exceeded. Requests at the limit continue to succeed.
- Applying an evaluator to an existing experiment could fail with "Failed to start evaluation" on large experiments. It now starts reliably even when the run count is temporarily unavailable.
- Linked runs load correctly from public dataset shares when LangSmith uses the ClickHouse compatibility path.

### Tracing

- The batched-run ingestion log now emits run_verbs as a list of run_id and verbs objects instead of a map keyed by run UUID, preventing structured-log aggregators from exhausting dynamic field limits.
- LangSmith now enforces user-defined monthly trace limits scoped to individual projects and users. New traces that exceed a configured limit are rejected, while patches and feedback for already-accepted traces continue to flow through.
- The tracing and evaluation onboarding quickstarts now show the correct LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT for bring-your-own-cloud data plane workspaces instead of the shared multi-tenant endpoint.
- Sharing, viewing, or unsharing any run in a trace now operates on the trace root, so every run in a shared trace is publicly viewable, and public run links open the selected run within the shared trace.
- Projects with existing traces no longer incorrectly display the onboarding screen when filtered or scoped to a time window with no recent runs. The project run-count check now looks back 30 days instead of the previous one-hour window.
- Bulk export compression now defaults to zstandard (zstd) for improved performance. Self-hosted environments retain the gzip default via the FF_BULK_EXPORT_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION environment variable.
- Authenticated users viewing public runs now see sidebar navigation for their last selected workspace. Logged-out viewers continue to see the public run without authenticated workspace navigation.
- LangSmith now returns clearer 409 Conflict messages when duplicate run create or update payloads are submitted. The message indicates whether the duplicate was a run create or run update request when possible.
- [LangSmith MCP tools](/langsmith/langsmith-mcp-server) that fetch runs or thread history now accept project UUIDs in addition to project names, making trace URL investigations faster and less error-prone.
- OpenTelemetry resource attributes (set via OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES) now appear on traces as metadata namespaced under otel.resource.*, so you can attach details like user IDs without changing how your tracer emits spans.
- Vercel AI SDK traces sent over raw OpenTelemetry now render in the Messages view. Previously these traces showed an empty Messages tab because no format adapter claimed them.
- Thread stats requests that opt into streaming now return the main stats first and add feedback stats when they are ready.
- Native OpenTelemetry child spans are no longer dropped when they arrive before an SDK-attributed parent span; they are buffered and correctly nested regardless of arrival order.
- When a runs query times out, the runs table now shows a timeout banner for better responsiveness.
- LLM spans in the trace view now show the model provider's brand logo (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google/Gemini, Azure, Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, and speech providers), resolved from the run's ls_provider metadata.
- LangSmith now preserves traces in multipart ingestion batches when one run has oversized inputs or outputs. Oversized input and output fields are replaced with a placeholder instead of rejecting the entire batch.
- Thread pages now show an explicit access-control message when trace loading is denied by ABAC, instead of a generic retrieval error.
- All time filters in tracing views now query the full retention window instead of falling back to a shorter backend default. This keeps trace, thread, and run results consistent when expanding the time range.
- OpenTelemetry traces from VS Code Copilot Chat now render as one clean nested trace per user turn. Auxiliary title/summary calls and orphaned tool spans are suppressed, message roles are corrected, token counts are de-duplicated, and standardized metadata (integration, agent runtime, thread ID, repo/git details) is attached automatically.
- Insights cluster run stats (run count, latency, tokens, and feedback) now reflect only the runs in each cluster instead of showing the same project-wide totals for every cluster.
- LangSmith Chat now authenticates to Chat LangChain with guest tokens when searching documentation, so docs answers keep working as Chat LangChain tightens authentication.
- The Trace Messages viewer now identifies the "main" conversation for traces that include middleware guardrails or subagent side-conversations, so the message list shows only the primary interaction instead of interleaving middleware/subagent partitions. Correctness is verified by an expanded snapshot suite covering 11 integrations across LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, Vercel AI SDK, Claude Agent SDK, deepagents, and raw provider wrappers.
- Fixed a bug where non-primitive metadata values did not appear in run details.
- Custom dashboard charts can now query P50 and P99 for input and output costs without failing runs analytics requests.
- Run stats scoped to an explicit run-id list (for example Insights per-cluster stats) now compute on SmithDB, which scopes results to those runs instead of falling back to project-wide totals.
- The thread stats API now accepts a `filter` query parameter, letting you scope aggregated stats to traces matching a LangSmith filter expression (e.g. start time or trace ID).
- Organization model settings now let you search pricing rules by model name, match rule, or provider. Paginated loading fetches additional rules as you scroll, making large numbers of model price maps manageable.
- LangSmith Chat now mints Managed Deep Agent guest tokens from the Chat LangChain LangGraph host (`POST /identity/guest`) when searching documentation, instead of the legacy Chat LangChain frontend guest route.
- Assistant messages carrying tool calls were rendered twice in the v2 messages view for traces produced by the @anthropic-ai/sdk JavaScript SDK. Dedup now normalizes content-block field order so the same message emitted as an LLM output and replayed as an input on the next turn collapses to a single row.
- Run errors whose stack trace arrived fully escaped (no real line breaks) now render as properly formatted multi-line text instead of one long wrapped line.
- LangSmith MCP's `fetch_runs` tool now accepts `min_start_time` and `max_start_time` arguments, so agents can search traces outside the default recent window.
- Adds a `GET /v2/runs/{run_id}/url` endpoint that returns the LangSmith UI URL for a specific run.

### Engine

- When an [Engine](/langsmith/engine) project reaches its monthly spend limit, the Next Run status chip and project spend card now show a clear "Monthly spend limit reached" state with a button that takes you straight to raising the limit.
- Upgrades the Redis client to improve recovery from Redis cluster topology changes, fixing cases where cluster reconnects could stall.
- Engine now lets the parent agent recover from model-actionable subtask failures and retries transient provider or network errors before failing a run. This helps issue scans continue through recoverable model errors while preserving hard failures for auth, configuration, and code exceptions.
- LangSmith exposes [Engine](/langsmith/engine) issue listing and retrieval through hosted MCP tools and generated SDK methods. Agents and API clients can fetch issue details directly by issue ID or filter issues by project, status, severity, tag, and update time.
- A new [Engine](/langsmith/engine) board callout points you to the trace-scope setting, where you can restrict Engine's reviews to runs matching a run name or metadata value.
- Engine-generated examples with assertions now add the Assertions evaluator when saved to a dataset from an annotation queue, matching the direct Add offline examples flow.
- The Engine setup screen now shows an estimated monthly cost based on the project's recent trace volume and size, so you know roughly what to expect before starting analysis.
- The Engine issue list now uses a single filter and sort menu with a compact, nested layout for Priority, Status, Tags, and Sort by, replacing the previous two separate popovers.
- The [Engine](/langsmith/engine) issue list now shows the active sort order as a removable chip next to your filter chips whenever it differs from the default.
- Engine issues can now be marked Fixing or Watching, and you can get a Slack alert when new traces recur on a watched issue.
- The [Engine](/langsmith/engine) issue list no longer shows scan-timing details (next scan countdown, last run time, or a Run now action); a Pause/Resume control remains available in its own section in board settings.
- Engine now verifies concrete claims in agent responses against trace evidence, improving detection of ungrounded artifacts, values, and claimed actions.

### Prompts and playground

- Self-hosted Playground and evaluator outbound model calls now honor proxy environment variables while preserving SSRF validation on every request.
- When you save a prompt to an application from the playground, LangSmith keeps the workspace application filter on All Applications instead of switching the rest of the UI to that application.
- Typing a workspace member's name or email in the [Context Hub](/langsmith/prompt-context-hub#context-hub) search box now also returns the prompts and resources they created.
- The playground now includes Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Fable 5, and Claude Opus 4.8 in the Anthropic, Bedrock, and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform model selectors. New Anthropic playground sessions default to Claude Sonnet 5.
- Playground and evaluator calls to Amazon Bedrock using IAM Trusted Entity now resolve the correct LangSmith AWS credentials before assuming customer roles in AWS-hosted LangSmith. This fixes failures that reported "Failed to assume role" before the customer role was assumed.
- Playground runs now retain evaluator scores and reasoning while backend feedback updates are polled, preventing completed results from appearing blank.
- Outbound model calls that route through a forward proxy now send the original hostname in the proxy CONNECT tunnel instead of a resolved IP, so proxies that allowlist tunnel targets by domain no longer reject them. This fixes self-hosted Playground and evaluator calls to internal OpenAI-compatible endpoints reachable only through such a proxy.
- Reviewing a prompt commit now displays every extra parameter (such as verbosity) set on the model, not just a fixed subset.
- LangSmith now waits for model preset defaults to finish loading before initializing the Playground, preventing OpenAI from replacing a custom default preset during page load.
- The model configuration default button now switches to a selected state when you make a preset your default.
- Playground model settings now apply typed custom model names when the selector closes, so you no longer need to click the typed option explicitly.
- Custom evaluator errors in the Playground results table now reliably show the failure message, instead of sometimes displaying a blank error indicator.
- Configure workspace-wide HTTPS webhooks for every Context Hub commit, with signed payloads, custom headers, and secret rotation controls.

### Feedback

- Editing the score on evaluator-generated feedback (for example from the experiment comparison view) now saves correctly instead of failing with "Failed to add feedback correction".
- POST requests to add runs to an annotation queue accept an optional `extend_trace_retention` query parameter. When set to false, short-lived traces are not upgraded to extended retention. The default remains true for backward compatibility.
- Adding feedback or reviewer notes from the LangSmith UI no longer upgrades short-lived traces to extended retention. Long-lived traces are unchanged.
- Feedback statistics queries now route through the official ClickHouse client, resolving query failures and improving compatibility with ClickHouse 25.x.
- Feedback creation resolves run metadata from SmithDB when the client provides session and start time, so SmithDB-only deployments no longer depend on ClickHouse for eager feedback writes.
- Adding runs to an annotation queue via the by-key endpoint now falls back to the ClickHouse run lookup when SmithDB queries are disabled, so the SDK's annotation-queue additions work regardless of whether SmithDB is enabled.
- The POST /feedback/eager endpoint is deprecated in favor of POST /feedback and is scheduled for removal on 2026-08-10. Update any direct integrations calling /feedback/eager to use POST /feedback instead.
- Feedback creation now accepts a thread identifier, enabling feedback to be associated with a conversation thread instead of only an individual run or session.
- GET feedback requests can now filter by a thread ID within a project, making thread-level feedback retrievable without resolving a run first.
- Annotation queue rubric feedback now loads the thread-scoped feedback for thread queue items.
- Annotation queue rubric feedback now saves against the selected thread for thread queue items.

### Monitoring and alerting

- Alert chart previews now handle relative date ranges consistently, preventing failures when loading 14-day or 30-day previews.
- Dashboard chart tooltips and axes now show up to eight fractional digits (previously two), so very small costs and rates no longer round down to zero.
- Time-series charts on custom dashboards now leave gaps for missing data points instead of plotting them as zero, and lines connect across those gaps so trends remain readable.
- When a custom dashboard chart has no data or would produce too many bins, the empty state now surfaces the active stride (e.g. 1M) and selected range (e.g. Last 12 hours) so it's clear what to adjust.
- When hovering the +N chip in a dashboard chart's legend, the expanded popover now paints above adjacent chart cards instead of being clipped behind them.
- Metadata grouping keys without returned values no longer show a misleading empty value tooltip in dashboards.

### Automations

- Applying a prebuilt evaluator without a filter now defaults to running on root runs only, matching manually created evaluators. Previously it ran on every nested run in a trace.
- Turning an online evaluator or automation on or off now saves for any role that can edit rules, instead of silently reverting for members without the retention-configuration permission.
- Resolved an unbounded memory leak in the SAQ queue worker where croniter objects were rebuilt every second, accumulating cached entries that were never released. The croniter dependency is bumped to 6.2.2+ and croniter objects are now reused across schedule ticks.

## Deployment

- Self-hosted deployments can now request CPU and memory above the previous Cloud limits of 8/16 cores and 32/16 GB, bounded only by your cluster capacity. Lower bounds, multiple-of-128 granularity, and Redis memory ordering are still enforced.
- Custom Slack app triggers can now opt in to let third-party bots trigger an agent. Enable the allow bot triggers toggle on a registration to accept events from external bots; echoes from your own and other LangSmith-registered bots are still dropped to prevent loops.
- Agents now skip unreachable or misconfigured non-default MCP servers immediately instead of retrying them, removing a slow round-trip from the tool-loading step and cutting time-to-first-token.
- Standby (uptime) minutes for LangGraph Platform deployments could be billed more than once when replicas reported overlapping intervals across separate usage-reporting runs. Reporting now deduplicates each minute across runs so it is billed at most once.
- The multi-select dropdown (e.g. Selected Tools) on the Studio assistants page now renders above the configuration dialog instead of behind it, so its options are visible and selectable.
- Redis connections using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure IAM) authentication now re-authenticate automatically before the access token expires, so long-lived connections no longer drop. Clustered Azure Redis is now supported for IAM auth as well.
- The deployment Crons tab now shows each schedule in your local timezone instead of raw UTC, matching the Next Run Date column.
- LangSmith Deployment now supports updating a deployment to a fixed resource tier through the control plane API. The update applies the selected tier's resource configuration, resizes Cloud SQL or RDS, and rolls a new revision.
- You can now edit an existing cron's schedule, input, and end time from a deployment's Crons tab, instead of deleting and recreating it.
- You can now rename a deployment from its Settings: give it a friendly display name without recreating it. The deployment's URLs and infrastructure are unchanged.
- LangSmith frontend images now install nginx 1.31 packages to pick up the latest Chainguard security fixes.
- Deployment creation now checks free deployment usage with the same backend quota count used during submission, preventing the form from offering a free Serverless or Development option when the organization quota is already used.
- LangSmith Deployment now lets you update compute and database resource tiers independently for supported hosted deployments. The scaling action applies the selected resources and rolls out a new revision.
- Hosted project deployment views now label scale-to-zero development deployments as Serverless, with free deployments shown as Serverless (free).
- The deployment form now shows the free serverless option immediately while checking an organization's remaining deployment allowance.
- Refines error handling when attempting to create a deployment with no GitHub repository selected.
- Serverless deployments can now update compute tiers correctly without requiring an external database tier.
- Self-hosted deployments now authenticate correctly to node-based AWS ElastiCache with IAM in both single-node and cluster configurations.

## Sandboxes

- Sandbox command output is now re-chunked into bounded single WebSocket frames, so clients that do not reassemble continuation frames (including the Go SDK) can read large streamed or replayed output without truncated JSON.
- S3 sandbox mounts now default endpoint_url to https://s3.amazonaws.com when it is not provided, so the field is no longer required when mounting standard AWS S3 buckets.
- Sandboxes can now burst CPU up to 2x their requested allocation when the host has spare capacity, and you can request fractional (sub-core) vCPU down to 0.05.
- When creating a sandbox, you can now configure Git, S3, and GCS filesystem mounts, including mount paths, Git remotes, bucket settings, and cache options. Configured mounts appear in the sandbox table and detail view.
- The LangSmith SDKs now support creating, listing, updating, and deleting sandbox registries for pulling private container images, alongside the existing sandbox and snapshot operations.
- Sandbox creation no longer fails intermittently with "sandbox not ready" errors when an underlying host is disrupted. Affected capacity now retries the contended resource lock and recovers automatically instead of leaving the pool degraded.
- Sandbox host startup now validates the full version directory before reuse, so a missing initrd no longer causes create-time failures after a partial or stale install.
- Creating a sandbox snapshot from a Docker image now records the image's tag (e.g. ubuntu:24.04 becomes the 24.04 tag), and creating a sandbox from a snapshot name without a tag resolves the latest tag, mirroring Docker.
- Self-hosted LangSmith installations now show the Sandboxes navigation item and use the instance-level sandbox flag to open the Sandboxes page.
- Shells and tools inside a sandbox now report the sandbox's name as the hostname instead of a generic default, and the name resolves from within the sandbox.
- Self-hosted LangSmith installations can open the Sandboxes page without enabling the Deployments frontend.
- Sandboxes now set common CA-bundle environment variables by default, so Python, Node, Deno, curl, and git tooling automatically trusts the sandbox's egress proxy certificate and no longer fails with TLS certificate-verification errors when its traffic is proxied.
- Sandboxes can now opt into keeping their memory when they stop, so the next start resumes where it left off instead of cold-booting. Set preserve_memory_on_stop when creating a sandbox; it defaults to off.

## Administration

- The roles table on the Organization Roles settings page now scrolls correctly when there are more roles than fit on screen.
- A new Project and user limits tab on the enterprise Usage configuration page lets you set monthly trace-count limits scoped to a specific project or user. Add, edit, and delete limits from the page.
- Anonymous organizations now show an "Anonymity mode is on" banner on the members page, and the usage breakdown hides the group-by-user option for non-internal viewers.
- New API keys now default to a finite expiration date instead of requiring a custom value. When an organization enforces a shorter maximum, the form defaults to that maximum instead.
- You can now fetch a single workspace directly via GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id} instead of listing all workspaces and filtering client-side.
- Org and workspace admins can now edit the role of a pending member invite directly from the Members settings page, without needing to cancel and re-send the invite.
- The Usage limits page now shows each workspace's configured total and extended (long-lived) trace limits, including caps that were previously hidden while the spend limit displayed "Unlimited".
- The batch workspace invite endpoint no longer returns a 409 error when inviting users who are already pending org invitees or active org members. Those users are added directly to the workspace without requiring a new org invite.
- The role selector in the edit pending member invite dialog now uses a scrollable select, matching the invite flow. This ensures all custom roles are accessible when many workspace roles are defined.
- Self-hosted deployments can now encode spaces in the OIDC authorization request as %20 instead of +, so single sign-on works with identity providers that reject the default + encoding of the scope list. Enable it by setting OAUTH_URL_ENCODE_SCOPE_SPACES=true.
- Billing upgrade dialogs now stay within the viewport and scroll when payment or business details make the form taller than the screen.
- Non-admin callers with manage-members permission can no longer assign restricted roles to workspace members or invite users with restricted roles to the workspace.
- Filter the organization's service keys and personal access tokens by workspace on the API keys settings page.
- Users without workspaces:manage permission cannot use restricted roles for invites, role changes, or user deletions in the UI.
- Organization admins can disable model providers across every workspace from organization settings. Disabled providers are hidden in the playground, evaluators, Fleet, and other model pickers, and workspace admins cannot re-enable them.
- Adding existing active or pending organization members to a workspace no longer fails when organization-level invites are disabled. Disabled org invites continue to block new organization invitees.
- The Roles settings page now scrolls correctly when an organization has more roles than fit on screen.
- Organization admins can once again edit the role of and remove other organization admins from the Organization Members settings page. Organization Operators, who share the same admin-level permissions but should not manage other admins, are now correctly prevented from editing, removing, or promoting members to Organization Admin.
- The email confirmation page now shows only the Confirm account step in the sidebar instead of future onboarding steps you have not reached yet.
- Self-hosted deployments now apply explicit DEFAULT_ORG_FEATURE_* and DEFAULT_FEATURE_* environment variables over stored organization and tenant config values, so operators can enable or disable features and limits globally without editing Postgres.
- The navigation product switcher now shows the configured organization logo alongside the LangSmith or Fleet wordmark instead of repeating the organization logo.
- Organization admins can now toggle role restriction from the Roles settings page. Restricted roles can only be assigned by users with the workspaces:manage permission.
- The organization-wide public sharing toggle now lives on the General settings page alongside the other organization settings, replacing its standalone Configuration section.
- When a user is removed from all mapped SSO groups, the organization and workspace access granted through SSO group sync is revoked on their next sign-in. Access assigned by other means (SCIM, JIT, or manual invitation) is unaffected.
- Workspace invite batch requests are now rate limited per workspace to reduce bulk invitation abuse. [Learn more](/langsmith/usage-and-billing#workspace-invite-batch-endpoint).
- Workspace switcher labels now show the full workspace name on hover when the visible label is truncated. This makes similarly prefixed workspace names easier to distinguish.
- LangSmith Home now shows a banner promoting Interrupt, our agent conference in London and NYC this fall, with a link to get tickets.
- Some new users could get stuck on the last onboarding step, with a loading spinner that never finished. This is now fixed.
- Organization admins can now rename their organization directly from the organization switcher in settings.
- Organization admins can now generate, view, and delete SCIM bearer tokens directly from Settings > Access and Security, instead of using the API, to set up SCIM provisioning with their identity provider. [Learn more](/langsmith/user-management#set-up-scim-for-your-organization).

### LLM Gateway

- LLM gateway data protection policies can now configure whether a guard pipeline timeout allows the request through or blocks it. Existing policies default to allowing requests on timeout.
- The LLM gateway now supports POST /openai/v1/responses/compact (and the legacy /responses/compact), routing it through the chat-shape responses handler.
- Guard policies now let you choose which PII rule categories to detect, with separate faster rule-based and slower model-based detection options, instead of a single on/off PII toggle.
- Gateway guard secret redaction now detects additional token formats, including SendGrid API tokens, Google OAuth access tokens, JWTs, Slack webhook URLs, and legacy LangSmith keys.
- When a gateway spend-cap policy targets more than one user, workspace, or API key, the create/edit policy form now explains that the limit applies to the combined spend across the selected entities rather than per entity.
- The LLM gateway now forwards every documented OpenAI API route it does not handle directly (models, files, batches, images, and more) to the upstream provider, so clients can reach the full OpenAI surface through the gateway. Custom OpenAI-compatible providers inherit the same passthrough routes.
- The LLM Gateway policies page now lets you sort each section by spend limit or usage percentage, and filter down to a specific workspace, user, or API key.
- LLM gateway data protection redaction now prepends a short disclaimer to redacted message text so models know SAFE_TO_USE placeholders are safe to reuse verbatim.
- The LLM Gateway now proxies Anthropic's Files and Managed Agents endpoints, so you can use them with your gateway-managed workspace key alongside Messages and Models.
- Creating an LLM Gateway spend or data protection policy now applies to the organization you are signed in to, replacing the organization dropdown with a read-only display of the current organization.
- Long selected values, like a user's email in the Gateway Policies filter, now truncate with an ellipsis instead of overlapping the dropdown chevron.
- The LLM Gateway now accepts workspace-scoped LangSmith OAuth bearer tokens across its provider routes, so OAuth clients can invoke configured models without a LangSmith API key.


## Other

- When you add runs to an [annotation queue](/langsmith/annotation-queues) without specifying `extend_trace_retention`, short-lived traces stay on short-lived retention. Pass `extend_trace_retention=true` to upgrade traces to extended retention.

## Observability and evaluations

### Datasets and experiments

- Model, prompt, and tool chips in the Experiments table config cells now lay out from real measurements for accurate truncation, and the +N overflow badge is a clickable dropdown whose entries expose the same actions (filter, group by, open in playground, and details) as a chip's own menu.
- Expanding the run tree for repetition runs in [experiment comparison](/langsmith/compare-experiment-results) views now works reliably when a repetition root has a `project ID` but no `session ID`.
- Evaluators linked to Hub prompts now load correctly for flat and playground-shaped prompt commits, fixing crashes when editing existing evaluators.
- Code evaluator upload now accepts Python entrypoints annotated with PEP 604 union return types (for example `-> dict | None`).
- `POST /v2/datasets/{dataset_id}/experiment-runs` is the supported public API for paginated experiment comparison. Legacy dataset comparison helpers are removed from the public OpenAPI spec and generated SDKs; existing HTTP routes continue to work for LangSmith UI clients.
- Each example's dataset splits now render as chips in the dataset Examples table, laid out from real measurements with a clickable +N overflow menu when an example belongs to more splits than fit the column.
- The experiment comparison view now offers an optional, reorderable "Splits (latest)" column that shows each example's current dataset split assignments as chips, reflecting live membership rather than the as-of-run snapshot.
- Evaluator spend charts on project and dataset evaluator tabs keep their desktop layout on narrow screens and scroll horizontally instead of compressing the chart and stat cards.
- The experiment comparison and group-by views now show each example's current dataset split rather than the split it had when the experiment ran, so you can tell whether failures already belong to a split without re-running the experiment.
- Comparison view now loads token and cost stats from SmithDB for root runs, so the stats columns populate again instead of staying blank
- LangSmith now caps reusable evaluators per workspace to prevent unbounded resource growth. Contact support if your workspace needs a higher limit.
- Creating dataset examples from source runs now correctly fetches run inputs and outputs backed by SmithDB, and no longer fails the whole request if one of several source runs can't be found.
- Select multiple rows in an experiment (or select all matching the current filters) and add, replace, or remove their dataset splits in one action, or copy the selected examples to another dataset, instead of editing rows one at a time.
- The `/runs/rules/validate` endpoint now supports [thread evaluators](/langsmith/online-evaluations-multi-turn). Pass `test_thread_id` and `session_id` to test a multi-turn evaluator against a real conversation before saving.
- Custom code evaluators that time out or fail on a run now record an error on that run instead of silently leaving it without feedback, so partial evaluation failures are visible on the experiment.
- The Open source run action on an example page now reads session and start time from dedicated example fields populated at creation, enabling reliable navigation to the source trace on SmithDB.
- The thread evaluator config preview now shows the thread message formats the evaluator actually maps, instead of listing every available format.
- The evaluator config now shows a locked "Trace count ≥ 2" filter for managed thread evaluators, making it clear they only run on threads with multiple turns.
- Experiment comparison and individual experiment views now load run rows on self-hosted deployments that authenticate the UI via SSO/OAuth session cookies. Previously these views could show 'No results found' even though metrics and feedback loaded.
- Experiment statistics now refresh promptly for recently run experiments while keeping historical experiment scans bounded.
- The Assertions evaluator added via "Add evaluator" now reads assertions from the reference output like the auto-attached version, so it grades against the real assertions instead of always failing.
- Evaluator spend chart y-axes now abbreviate amounts of $1,000 or more, making high-spend values easier to scan.
- A run rule whose sampling rate was 0 (or unset) sent an out-of-range sample_rate to the SmithDB query service (which rejected it) and zeroed out ClickHouse thread grouping. Both the flat and grouped fetch paths now fall back to 1.0 (no sampling) so these rules query successfully.
- Exporting a dataset comparison view as CSV now returns a clear "file is too large to export" error instead of a generic server error when the export exceeds internal size limits.
- Each split chip in a row's Splits cell is now interactive in the experiment results and comparison views, with an Edit splits action that opens the single-example split picker so you can reassign splits without leaving the table.

### Tracing

- The batched-run ingestion log now emits run_verbs as a list of run_id and verbs objects instead of a map keyed by run UUID, preventing structured-log aggregators from exhausting dynamic field limits.
- LangSmith now enforces user-defined monthly trace limits scoped to individual projects and users. New traces that exceed a configured limit are rejected, while patches and feedback for already-accepted traces continue to flow through.
- The tracing and evaluation onboarding quickstarts now show the correct `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` for bring-your-own-cloud data plane workspaces instead of the shared multi-tenant endpoint.
- Sharing, viewing, or unsharing any run in a trace now operates on the trace root, so every run in a shared trace is publicly viewable, and public run links open the selected run within the shared trace.
- Projects with existing traces no longer incorrectly display the onboarding screen when filtered or scoped to a time window with no recent runs. The project run-count check now looks back 30 days instead of the previous one-hour window.
- Bulk export compression now defaults to zstandard (zstd) for improved performance. Self-hosted environments retain the gzip default via the `FF_BULK_EXPORT_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION` environment variable.
- Authenticated users viewing public runs now see sidebar navigation for their last selected workspace. Logged-out viewers continue to see the public run without authenticated workspace navigation.
- LangSmith now returns clearer 409 Conflict messages when duplicate run create or update payloads are submitted. The message indicates whether the duplicate was a run create or run update request when possible.
- LangSmith MCP tools that fetch runs or thread history now accept project UUIDs in addition to project names, making trace URL investigations faster and less error-prone.
- OpenTelemetry resource attributes (set via `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`) now appear on traces as metadata namespaced under `otel.resource.*`, so you can attach details like user IDs without changing how your tracer emits spans.
- Vercel AI SDK traces sent over raw OpenTelemetry now render in the Messages view. Previously these traces showed an empty Messages tab because no format adapter claimed them.
- Thread stats requests that opt into streaming now return the main stats first and add feedback stats when they are ready.
- Native OpenTelemetry child spans are no longer dropped when they arrive before an SDK-attributed parent span; they are buffered and correctly nested regardless of arrival order.
- When a runs query times out, the runs table now shows a timeout banner for better responsiveness.
- LangSmith now preserves traces in multipart ingestion batches when one run has oversized inputs or outputs. Oversized input and output fields are replaced with a placeholder instead of rejecting the entire batch.
- Thread pages now show an explicit access-control message when trace loading is denied by ABAC, instead of a generic retrieval error.
- All time filters in tracing views now query the full retention window instead of falling back to a shorter backend default. This keeps trace, thread, and run results consistent when expanding the time range.
- OpenTelemetry traces from VS Code Copilot Chat now render as one clean nested trace per user turn. Auxiliary title/summary calls and orphaned tool spans are suppressed, message roles are corrected, token counts are de-duplicated, and standardized metadata (integration, agent runtime, thread ID, repo/git details) is attached automatically.
- Insights cluster run stats (run count, latency, tokens, and feedback) now reflect only the runs in each cluster instead of showing the same project-wide totals for every cluster.
- LangSmith Chat now authenticates to Chat LangChain with guest tokens when searching documentation, so docs answers keep working as Chat LangChain tightens authentication.
- The Trace Messages viewer now identifies the "main" conversation for traces that include middleware guardrails or subagent side-conversations, so the message list shows only the primary interaction instead of interleaving middleware/subagent partitions. Correctness is verified by an expanded snapshot suite covering 11 integrations across LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, Vercel AI SDK, Claude Agent SDK, deepagents, and raw provider wrappers.
- Custom dashboard charts can now query P50 and P99 for input and output costs without failing runs analytics requests.
- The thread stats API now accepts a `filter` query parameter, letting you scope aggregated stats to traces matching a LangSmith filter expression (e.g. start time or trace ID).
- LangSmith Chat now mints Managed Deep Agent guest tokens from the Chat LangChain LangGraph host (`POST /identity/guest`) when searching documentation, instead of the legacy Chat LangChain frontend guest route.

### Engine

- When an Engine project reaches its monthly spend limit, the Next Run status chip and project spend card now show a clear "Monthly spend limit reached" state with a button that takes you straight to raising the limit.
- Upgrades the Redis client to improve recovery from Redis cluster topology changes, fixing cases where cluster reconnects could stall.
- Engine now lets the parent agent recover from model-actionable subtask failures and retries transient provider or network errors before failing a run. This helps issue scans continue through recoverable model errors while preserving hard failures for auth, configuration, and code exceptions.
- LangSmith exposes Engine issue listing and retrieval through hosted MCP tools and generated SDK methods. Agents and API clients can fetch issue details directly by issue ID or filter issues by project, status, severity, tag, and update time.
- A new Engine board callout points you to the trace-scope setting, where you can restrict Engine's reviews to runs matching a run name or metadata value.
- Engine-generated examples with assertions now add the Assertions evaluator when saved to a dataset from an annotation queue, matching the direct Add offline examples flow.
- The Engine issue list now uses a single filter and sort menu with a compact, collapsible layout for Priority, Status, Tags, and Sort by, replacing the previous two separate popovers.
- The Engine issue list now shows the active sort order as a removable chip next to your filter chips whenever it differs from the default.
- The Engine issue list no longer shows scan-timing details (next scan countdown, last run time, or a Run now action); a Pause/Resume control remains available in its own section in board settings.

### Prompts and playground

- Self-hosted Playground and evaluator outbound model calls now honor proxy environment variables while preserving SSRF validation on every request.
- When you save a prompt to an application from the playground, LangSmith keeps the workspace application filter on All Applications instead of switching the rest of the UI to that application.
- Typing a workspace member's name or email in the Context Hub search box now also returns the prompts and resources they created.
- The playground now includes Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Fable 5, and Claude Opus 4.8 in the Anthropic, Bedrock, and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform model selectors. New Anthropic playground sessions default to Claude Sonnet 5.
- Playground and evaluator calls to Amazon Bedrock using IAM Trusted Entity now resolve the correct LangSmith AWS credentials before assuming customer roles in AWS-hosted LangSmith. This fixes failures that reported "Failed to assume role" before the customer role was assumed.
- Outbound model calls that route through a forward proxy now send the original hostname in the proxy CONNECT tunnel instead of a resolved IP, so proxies that allowlist tunnel targets by domain no longer reject them. This fixes self-hosted Playground and evaluator calls to internal OpenAI-compatible endpoints reachable only through such a proxy.
- Reviewing a prompt commit now displays every extra parameter (such as verbosity) set on the model, not just a fixed subset.

### Feedback

- Editing the score on evaluator-generated feedback (for example from the experiment comparison view) now saves correctly instead of failing with "Failed to add feedback correction".
- POST requests to add runs to an annotation queue accept an optional `extend_trace_retention` query parameter. When set to false, short-lived traces are not upgraded to extended retention. The default remains true for backward compatibility.
- Adding feedback or reviewer notes from the LangSmith UI no longer upgrades short-lived traces to extended retention. Long-lived traces are unchanged.
- Feedback statistics queries now route through the official ClickHouse client, resolving query failures and improving compatibility with ClickHouse 25.x.
- Feedback creation resolves run metadata from SmithDB when the client provides session and start time, so SmithDB-only deployments no longer depend on ClickHouse for eager feedback writes.
- The `POST /feedback/eager` endpoint is deprecated in favor of `POST /feedback` and is scheduled for removal on 2026-08-10. Update any direct integrations calling `/feedback/eager` to use `POST /feedback` instead.

### Monitoring and alerting

- Alert chart previews now handle relative date ranges consistently, preventing failures when loading 14-day or 30-day previews.
- Dashboard chart tooltips and axes now show up to eight fractional digits (previously two), so very small costs and rates no longer round down to zero.
- Time-series charts on custom dashboards now leave gaps for missing data points instead of plotting them as zero, and lines connect across those gaps so trends remain readable.

### Automations

- Applying a prebuilt evaluator without a filter now defaults to running on root runs only, matching manually created evaluators. Previously it ran on every nested run in a trace.
- Turning an online evaluator or automation on or off now saves for any role that can edit rules, instead of silently reverting for members without the retention-configuration permission.

## Deployment

- Self-hosted deployments can now request CPU and memory above the previous Cloud limits of 8/16 cores and 32/16 GB, bounded only by your cluster capacity. Lower bounds, multiple-of-128 granularity, and Redis memory ordering are still enforced.
- Custom Slack app triggers can now opt in to let third-party bots trigger an agent. Enable the allow bot triggers toggle on a registration to accept events from external bots; echoes from your own and other LangSmith-registered bots are still dropped to prevent loops.
- Agents now skip unreachable or misconfigured non-default MCP servers immediately instead of retrying them, removing a slow round-trip from the tool-loading step and cutting time-to-first-token.
- Standby (uptime) minutes for LangGraph Platform deployments could be billed more than once when replicas reported overlapping intervals across separate usage-reporting runs. Reporting now deduplicates each minute across runs so it is billed at most once.
- The multi-select dropdown (e.g. Selected Tools) on the Studio assistants page now renders above the configuration dialog instead of behind it, so its options are visible and selectable.
- Redis connections using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure IAM) authentication now re-authenticate automatically before the access token expires, so long-lived connections no longer drop. Clustered Azure Redis is now supported for IAM auth as well.
- The deployment Crons tab now shows each schedule in your local timezone instead of raw UTC, matching the Next Run Date column.
- LangSmith Deployment now supports updating a deployment to a fixed resource tier through the control plane API. The update applies the selected tier's resource configuration, resizes Cloud SQL or RDS, and rolls a new revision.
- You can now rename a deployment from its Settings: give it a friendly display name without recreating it. The deployment's URLs and infrastructure are unchanged.

## Sandboxes

- Sandbox command output is now re-chunked into bounded single WebSocket frames, so clients that do not reassemble continuation frames (including the Go SDK) can read large streamed or replayed output without truncated JSON.
- S3 sandbox mounts now default endpoint_url to https://s3.amazonaws.com when it is not provided, so the field is no longer required when mounting standard AWS S3 buckets.
- Sandboxes can now burst CPU up to 2x their requested allocation when the host has spare capacity, and you can request fractional (sub-core) vCPU down to 0.05.
- When creating a sandbox, you can now configure Git, S3, and GCS filesystem mounts, including mount paths, Git remotes, bucket settings, and cache options. Configured mounts appear in the sandbox table and detail view.
- The LangSmith SDKs now support creating, listing, updating, and deleting sandbox registries for pulling private container images, alongside the existing sandbox and snapshot operations.
- Sandbox creation no longer fails intermittently with "sandbox not ready" errors when an underlying host is disrupted. Affected capacity now retries the contended resource lock and recovers automatically instead of leaving the pool degraded.
- Sandbox host startup now validates the full version directory before reuse, so a missing initrd no longer causes create-time failures after a partial or stale install.
- Creating a sandbox snapshot from a Docker image now records the image's tag (e.g. ubuntu:24.04 becomes the 24.04 tag), and creating a sandbox from a snapshot name without a tag resolves the latest tag, mirroring Docker.
- Self-hosted LangSmith installations now show the Sandboxes navigation item and use the instance-level sandbox flag to open the Sandboxes page.
- Shells and tools inside a sandbox now report the sandbox's name as the hostname instead of a generic default, and the name resolves from within the sandbox.
- Self-hosted LangSmith installations can open the Sandboxes page without enabling the Deployments frontend.
- Sandboxes now set common CA-bundle environment variables by default, so Python, Node, Deno, curl, and git tooling automatically trusts the sandbox's egress proxy certificate and no longer fails with TLS certificate-verification errors when its traffic is proxied.

## Administration

- The roles table on the Organization Roles settings page now scrolls correctly when there are more roles than fit on screen.
- A new Project and user limits tab on the enterprise Usage configuration page lets you set monthly trace-count limits scoped to a specific project or user. Add, edit, and delete limits from the page.
- Anonymous organizations now show an "Anonymity mode is on" banner on the members page, and the usage breakdown hides the group-by-user option for non-internal viewers.
- New API keys now default to a finite expiration date instead of requiring a custom value. When an organization enforces a shorter maximum, the form defaults to that maximum instead.
- You can now fetch a single workspace directly via `GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}` instead of listing all workspaces and filtering client-side.
- Org and workspace admins can now edit the role of a pending member invite directly from the Members settings page, without needing to cancel and re-send the invite.
- The Usage limits page now shows each workspace's configured total and extended (long-lived) trace limits, including caps that were previously hidden while the spend limit displayed "Unlimited".
- The batch workspace invite endpoint no longer returns a 409 error when inviting users who are already pending org invitees or active org members. Those users are added directly to the workspace without requiring a new org invite.
- The role selector in the edit pending member invite dialog now uses a scrollable select, matching the invite flow. This ensures all custom roles are accessible when many workspace roles are defined.
- Self-hosted deployments can now encode spaces in the OIDC authorization request as %20 instead of +, so single sign-on works with identity providers that reject the default + encoding of the scope list. Enable it by setting OAUTH_URL_ENCODE_SCOPE_SPACES=true.
- Billing upgrade dialogs now stay within the viewport and scroll when payment or business details make the form taller than the screen.

- Filter the organization's service keys and personal access tokens by workspace on the API keys settings page.
- Users without workspaces:manage permission cannot use restricted roles for invites, role changes, or user deletions in the UI.
- Organization admins can disable model providers across every workspace from organization settings. Disabled providers are hidden in the playground, evaluators, Fleet, and other model pickers, and workspace admins cannot re-enable them.
- Adding existing active or pending organization members to a workspace no longer fails when organization-level invites are disabled. Disabled org invites continue to block new organization invitees.

- The email confirmation page now shows only the Confirm account step in the sidebar instead of future onboarding steps you have not reached yet.
- Self-hosted deployments now apply explicit DEFAULT_ORG_FEATURE_* and DEFAULT_FEATURE_* environment variables over stored organization and tenant config values, so operators can enable or disable features and limits globally without editing Postgres.
- The navigation product switcher now shows the configured organization logo alongside the LangSmith or Fleet wordmark instead of repeating the organization logo.
- Organization admins can now toggle role restriction from the Roles settings page. Restricted roles can only be assigned by users with the workspaces:manage permission.
- The organization-wide public sharing toggle now lives on the General settings page alongside the other organization settings, replacing its standalone Configuration section.

- When a gateway spend-cap policy targets more than one user, workspace, or API key, the create/edit policy form now explains that the limit applies to the combined spend across the selected entities rather than per entity.
- The LLM gateway now forwards every documented OpenAI API route it does not handle directly (models, files, batches, images, and more) to the upstream provider, so clients can reach the full OpenAI surface through the gateway. Custom OpenAI-compatible providers inherit the same passthrough routes.
- The LLM Gateway policies page now lets you sort each section by spend limit or usage percentage, and filter down to a specific workspace, user, or API key.

## Observability and evaluations

### Datasets and experiments

- Model, prompt, and tool chips in the [Experiments](/langsmith/analyze-an-experiment) table config cells now lay out from real measurements for accurate truncation, and the +N overflow badge is a clickable dropdown whose entries expose the same actions (filter, group by, open in playground, and details) as a chip's own menu.

- The Open source run action on an example page now reads session and start time from dedicated example fields populated at creation, enabling reliable navigation to the source trace on SmithDB.

### Tracing

- LangSmith now enforces user-defined monthly trace limits scoped to individual projects and users. New traces that exceed a configured limit are rejected, while patches and feedback for already-accepted traces continue to flow through.
- The tracing and evaluation onboarding quickstarts now show the correct `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` for bring-your-own-cloud data plane workspaces instead of the shared multi-tenant endpoint.
- Sharing, viewing, or unsharing any run in a trace now operates on the trace root, so every run in a shared trace is publicly viewable, and public run links open the selected run within the shared trace.
- Projects with existing traces no longer incorrectly display the onboarding screen when filtered or scoped to a time window with no recent runs. The project run-count check now looks back 30 days instead of the previous one-hour window.
- Bulk export compression now defaults to zstandard (zstd) for improved performance. Self-hosted environments retain the gzip default via the `FF_BULK_EXPORT_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION` environment variable.
- LangSmith now returns clearer 409 Conflict messages when duplicate run create or update payloads are submitted. The message indicates whether the duplicate was a run create or run update request when possible.
- LangSmith [MCP tools](/langsmith/langsmith-mcp-server) that fetch runs or thread history now accept `project UUIDs` in addition to project names, making trace URL investigations faster and less error-prone.
- OpenTelemetry resource attributes (set via `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`) now appear on traces as metadata namespaced under otel.resource.*, so you can attach details like user IDs without changing how your tracer emits spans.
- Vercel AI SDK traces sent over raw OpenTelemetry now render in the Messages view. Previously these traces showed an empty Messages tab because no format adapter claimed them.
- Thread stats requests that opt into streaming now return the main stats first and add feedback stats when they are ready.
- When a runs query times out, the runs table now shows a timeout banner for better responsiveness.
- LangSmith now preserves traces in multipart ingestion batches when one run has oversized inputs or outputs. Oversized input and output fields are replaced with a placeholder instead of rejecting the entire batch.

### Engine

- When an Engine project reaches its monthly spend limit, the Next Run status chip and project spend card now show a clear "Monthly spend limit reached" state with a button that takes you straight to raising the limit.
- LangSmith exposes Engine issue listing and retrieval through hosted [MCP tools](/langsmith/langsmith-mcp-server) and generated SDK methods. Agents and API clients can fetch issue details directly by `issue ID` or filter issues by project, status, severity, tag, and update time.
- A new Engine board callout points you to the trace-scope setting, where you can restrict Engine's reviews to runs matching a run name or metadata value.

### Prompts and playground

- Self-hosted [Playground](/langsmith/playground-model-providers) and evaluator outbound model calls now honor proxy environment variables while preserving SSRF validation on every request.
- When you save a prompt to an application from the playground, LangSmith keeps the workspace application filter on All Applications instead of switching the rest of the UI to that application.
- Typing a workspace member's name or email in the [Context Hub](/langsmith/prompt-context-hub#context-hub) search box now also returns the prompts and resources they created.
- The playground now includes Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Fable 5, and Claude Opus 4.8 in the Anthropic, Bedrock, and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform model selectors. New Anthropic playground sessions default to Claude Sonnet 5.

### Feedback

- Editing the score on evaluator-generated feedback (for example from the experiment comparison view) now saves correctly instead of failing with "Failed to add feedback correction".
- Adding feedback or reviewer notes from the LangSmith UI no longer upgrades short-lived traces to extended retention. Long-lived traces are unchanged.
- Feedback statistics queries now route through the official ClickHouse client, resolving query failures and improving compatibility with ClickHouse 25.x.

### Monitoring and alerting

- Alert chart previews now handle relative date ranges consistently, preventing failures when loading 14-day or 30-day previews.
- [Dashboards](/langsmith/dashboards) chart tooltips and axes now show up to eight fractional digits (previously two), so very small costs and rates no longer round down to zero.
- Time-series charts on custom dashboards now leave gaps for missing data points instead of plotting them as zero, and lines connect across those gaps so trends remain readable.

### Automations

- Applying a prebuilt evaluator without a filter now defaults to running on root runs only, matching manually created evaluators. Previously it ran on every nested run in a trace.
- Turning an online evaluator or automation on or off now saves for any role that can edit rules, instead of silently reverting for members without the retention-configuration permission.

## Deployment

- Self-hosted deployments can now request CPU and memory above the previous Cloud limits of 8/16 cores and 32/16 GB, bounded only by your cluster capacity. Lower bounds, multiple-of-128 granularity, and Redis memory ordering are still enforced.
- Custom Slack app triggers can now opt in to let third-party bots trigger an agent. Enable the allow bot triggers toggle on a registration to accept events from external bots; echoes from your own and other LangSmith-registered bots are still dropped to prevent loops.
- Agents now skip unreachable or misconfigured non-default MCP servers immediately instead of retrying them, removing a slow round-trip from the tool-loading step and cutting time-to-first-token.
- Standby (uptime) minutes for LangGraph Platform deployments could be billed more than once when replicas reported overlapping intervals across separate usage-reporting runs. Reporting now deduplicates each minute across runs so it is billed at most once.

## Sandboxes

- Sandbox command output is now re-chunked into bounded single WebSocket frames, so clients that do not reassemble continuation frames (including the Go SDK) can read large streamed or replayed output without truncated JSON.
- S3 sandbox mounts now default `endpoint_url` to https://s3.amazonaws.com when it is not provided, so the field is no longer required when mounting standard AWS S3 buckets.
- [Sandboxes](/langsmith/sandboxes) can now burst CPU up to 2x their requested allocation when the host has spare capacity, and you can request fractional (sub-core) vCPU down to 0.05.
- When creating a sandbox, you can now configure Git, S3, and GCS filesystem mounts, including mount paths, Git remotes, bucket settings, and cache options. Configured mounts appear in the sandbox table and detail view.
- The LangSmith SDKs now support creating, listing, updating, and deleting sandbox registries for pulling private container images, alongside the existing sandbox and snapshot operations.
- Sandbox snapshot builds can now request an XFS root filesystem for sandbox-host based environments.
- Sandbox creation no longer fails intermittently with "sandbox not ready" errors when an underlying host is disrupted. Affected capacity now retries the contended resource lock and recovers automatically instead of leaving the pool degraded.
- Sandbox host startup now validates the full version directory before reuse, so a missing initrd no longer causes create-time failures after a partial or stale install.
- Creating a sandbox snapshot from a Docker image now records the image's tag (e.g. ubuntu:24.04 becomes the 24.04 tag), and creating a sandbox from a snapshot name without a tag resolves the latest tag, mirroring Docker.
- Self-hosted LangSmith installations now show the [Sandboxes](/langsmith/sandboxes) navigation item and use the instance-level sandbox flag to open the Sandboxes page.

## Administration

- A new Project and user limits tab on the enterprise Usage configuration page lets you set monthly trace-count limits scoped to a specific project or user. Add, edit, and delete limits from the page.
- Anonymous organizations now show an "Anonymity mode is on" banner on the members page, and the usage breakdown hides the group-by-user option for non-internal viewers.
- New API keys now default to a finite expiration date instead of requiring a custom value. When an organization enforces a shorter maximum, the form defaults to that maximum instead.
- You can now fetch a single workspace directly via GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id} instead of listing all workspaces and filtering client-side.
- Org and workspace admins can now edit the role of a pending member invite directly from the Members settings page, without needing to cancel and re-send the invite.
- The Usage limits page now shows each workspace's configured total and extended (long-lived) trace limits, including caps that were previously hidden while the spend limit displayed "Unlimited".
- The batch workspace invite endpoint no longer returns a 409 error when inviting users who are already pending org invitees or active org members. Those users are added directly to the workspace without requiring a new org invite.
- The role selector in the edit pending member invite dialog now uses a scrollable select, matching the invite flow. This ensures all custom roles are accessible when many workspace roles are defined.
- Self-hosted deployments can now encode spaces in the OIDC authorization request as %20 instead of +, so single sign-on works with identity providers that reject the default + encoding of the scope list. Enable it by setting OAUTH_URL_ENCODE_SCOPE_SPACES=true.
- Billing upgrade dialogs now stay within the viewport and scroll when payment or business details make the form taller than the screen.
- Non-admin callers with manage-members permission can no longer assign restricted roles to workspace members or invite users with restricted roles to the workspace.
- Filter the organization's service keys and personal access tokens by workspace on the API keys settings page.
- Users without workspaces:manage permission cannot use restricted roles for invites, role changes, or user deletions in the UI.
- Adding existing active or pending organization members to a workspace no longer fails when organization-level invites are disabled. Disabled org invites continue to block new organization invitees.
- The Roles settings page now scrolls correctly when an organization has more roles than fit on screen.
- Organization admins can once again edit the role of and remove other organization admins from the Organization Members settings page. Organization Operators, who share the same admin-level permissions but should not manage other admins, are now correctly prevented from editing, removing, or promoting members to Organization Admin.

### LLM Gateway

- LLM gateway data protection policies can now configure whether a guard pipeline timeout allows the request through or blocks it. Existing policies default to allowing requests on timeout.
- The LLM gateway now supports POST /openai/v1/responses/compact (and the legacy /responses/compact), routing it through the chat-shape responses handler.
- Guard policies now let you choose which PII rule categories to detect, with separate faster rule-based and slower model-based detection options, instead of a single on/off PII toggle.
- Gateway guard secret redaction now detects additional token formats, including SendGrid API tokens, Google OAuth access tokens, JWTs, Slack webhook URLs, and legacy LangSmith keys.
- The [LLM Gateway](/langsmith/llm-gateway) policies page now lets you sort each section by spend limit or usage percentage, and filter down to a specific workspace, user, or API key.

## Fleet

- In the Agent Builder view, the footer workspace and tenant list is sourced from the Fleet API so you can switch between your Fleet workspaces.
- The Access Profiles dialog in chat now includes a Create an access profile link that opens the sandboxes create flow, so you can add a profile when a workspace has none configured instead of hitting a dead end.
- Fleet agents can now delete files from their memory and skills using the new delete tool, including files in linked workspace skills. Core agent files and read-only system skills remain protected.
- Fleet now completes OAuth for MCP servers whose authorization server requires client-secret authentication at the token endpoint, so connecting these servers no longer fails after the consent step.
- First-time Fleet users now see a streamlined welcome modal with two clear paths; describe an agent to build with AI (starting from a prompt in Chat) or start from a curated template; replacing the previous multi-step setup wizard.
- Creating an agent from a Fleet template now skips the setup wizard and opens the agent editor with the template onboarding card.
- Fleet now sends the MCP protocol version a server negotiates during the handshake, both when loading tools and when the agent calls them, so MCP servers that require a newer version no longer return zero tools or fail tool calls.
- Fleet agents receive the day of week alongside the current date (for example "Monday, June 29th 2026"), so scheduling and date reasoning no longer relies on the model inferring the weekday from the ISO date.
- File edits in Fleet agent chat now render as syntax-highlighted, line-by-line diffs, making changes easier to review.
- Fleet agents can now read files shared with them in Slack. Attach an image, PDF, audio, video, or text file in a mention or DM and the agent ingests it into the conversation.
- On the Agent Builder Integrations page, searching now selects the All tab so results span every category, and switching category tabs clears the search.
- When you connect a custom Slack bot to a Fleet agent, Fleet sends the installer a direct message with quick setup tips, including how to add the bot to channels and mention it with @.
- Fleet agents now have a Slack tool for listing channels the connected bot is a member of, making it easier to discover the right channel before posting or reading messages.
- Fleet OAuth provider and integration responses now include an `owner` field (`workspace` or `platform`) so you can tell your own resources apart from built-in, platform-managed ones. The platform manager organization can now create and modify built-in OAuth providers.
- Setting up a schedule is now clearer: choose a preset (daily, weekly, monthly, or every few minutes) or enter a custom cron expression, with a live human-readable preview and inline validation as you go.
- When registering an integration OAuth provider for headless connections, http:// redirect URIs are now accepted only for the loopback IP literals 127.0.0.1 or [::1]. The localhost hostname is no longer accepted over http; use the loopback IP literal or https.
- The MCP servers settings page now scrolls when the pointer is over the servers list.
- The load previous conversations tool now writes conversation files into the attached Computer sandbox when one is enabled, so agents can inspect the downloaded history with their normal file tools.
- When a Fleet agent's subagent calls a tool that requires human approval, the approval prompt now appears in the chat instead of the run completing without it.
- The Executive Assistant template can now deliver its daily brief and answer @mentions in Slack after you connect a Slack workspace, and both the Executive Assistant and Software Engineer templates received configuration fixes.
- You can now type and send a message in agent chat while a human-in-the-loop prompt is pending. Sending a new message dismisses the pending request and continues the conversation instead of leaving the composer locked.
- Empty sections in the agent configuration panel; Channels, Connections, Skills, Schedules, Instructions, and Subagents; now explain what each one is for and what you can add before you connect anything.
- Creating a new agent no longer fails with a contentBlocks.push error when the chat stream returns string message content.
- Opening an agent in the chat inbox no longer issues repeated duplicate background requests while choosing which thread to open, reducing flicker.
- Fleet agents now load your workspace's private skills. Previously, in workspaces with fine-grained access controls, an agent could start with only public skills available.
- Reloading an agent chat page no longer flashes the thread list through loading and loaded states multiple times. The sidebar now waits for agent scope to finish loading before fetching threads, so the list settles once.
- GitHub App installations now sync through the authenticated LangSmith session after installation completes, keeping workspace linking aligned with the active user.
- OAuth providers now accept an optional default redirect URI (`default_redirect_uri`). When set, headless OAuth flows for that provider return the authorization code to it instead of the LangSmith callback, without passing a redirect on every request. The value is validated against the provider's allowed redirect URIs.
- Fleet agents now discover tools with find_tools or an /tools listing before opening a tool's reference doc, so they no longer waste a turn reading guessed tool filenames that do not exist.
- The Fleet Fast model tier (gpt-5.4-mini) now runs at medium reasoning effort instead of low, improving response quality on harder tasks.
- The templates gallery now features the Executive Assistant and Software Engineer templates as large cards with a hero illustration, each showing the agent's own icon.
- Each tool inside a connection in the agent Configure panel now has a remove action (a trash button revealed on hover, matching the connection remove) instead of an on/off switch. The switch implied a reversible toggle, but turning a tool off actually removed it from the agent, and the control now reflects what it does.
- Sending a chat message while clarifying questions were pending could fail the run and leave the thread stuck. Free-text now correctly dismisses the pending request before continuing.
- In the Agent Builder chat, the Skills block's "Add skill" menu now opens the browse-workspace, create-skill, and import-from-URL dialogs. Previously choosing an option changed the URL but nothing appeared.
- Opening an agent in Fleet now always starts a new chat instead of jumping into a recent thread. Past conversations remain available in the thread sidebar.
- When an agent created from a template introduces itself, it writes what it learns straight to its own memory instead of pausing for approval on every file. Memory writes in your other threads still ask first.
- Skill descriptions containing quotes, colons, or multiple lines are now parsed and stored correctly, and importing or editing a skill preserves all of its frontmatter instead of dropping fields like license or allowed-tools.
- The Add connection dialog now groups Arcade MCP servers under a dedicated Arcade section, so they are easy to find instead of being listed under Other.
- Fleet access profiles now show Custom rule, AWS access, and GCP access options alongside service templates, including configurable GCP OAuth scopes, so you can configure computer credentials without leaving the setup flow. [Learn more](/langsmith/fleet/computer-use).
- Agent calendar tools now render event times and day ranges in your timezone instead of a fixed default, so daily briefings are correct for scheduled and Slack-triggered runs, not just those started from the browser.
- The Fleet model picker now groups served, LCU-billed models (Fast, Pro, Max) separately from bring-your-own models billed per run, making the pricing model for each option clearer.
- The compact Fast/Pro/Max model picker in Agent Builder now shows the model icon on its closed trigger, matching the full model picker.
- When an organization reaches its monthly Fleet usage limit, the error now directs users to upgrade their plan to continue.
- Reopening or reloading an agent chat thread while a run is still in progress no longer crashes the chat view. The chat shows a loading state until the agent is ready, then resumes streaming the active run.
- The Fleet usage dashboard now shows a meter for orgs with a monthly LangChain Unit (LCU) spend limit, comparing month-to-date consumption against the limit and any overage.
- Arcade MCP gateways configured with Arcade Headers (API-key) authentication can no longer be added to a Fleet workspace, because LangSmith connects to Arcade gateways over OAuth. These gateways now explain how to reconfigure them with Arcade Auth or a User Source instead of failing when you try to connect.
- Fleet now labels the agent card action as Configure, matching the action in the chat view.
- When a Google Docs, Sheets, Drive, or Slides tool can't open a file (a 403 or 404), the agent now explains it can only access files it created itself with its connected Google account, instead of wrongly saying the file doesn't exist.
- Fleet now shows a warning; inline above the failing tool call in chat, and as a message in Slack; when a Google Docs, Sheets, Drive, or Slides tool hits a 403 or 404, explaining the agent can only access files it created itself with its connected Google account.
- Fleet's configure panel now shows the connection format selector so you can choose whether an agent uses shared or per-user accounts.
- Agents connected to Slack can now send a file from their workspace into a Slack channel using the new slack_send_file tool; for example a report, export, or chart the agent has generated. The file is uploaded server-side and the agent never sees the Slack token.
- Fleet agents retain DeltaChannel conversation history when thread state is updated, including when users continue trigger-started conversations in chat.
- Fleet thread APIs can now include the current agent's ID and name, making thread lists and details easier to display without fetching full agent records.
- Fleet agents with Slack file tools can now send files from thread-scoped and agent-scoped sandbox workspaces.
- Fleet agents can use a built-in configuration-hardening skill to selectively separate trust boundaries, minimize tools, require approval for sensitive actions, and review access.
- Chat messages that attach a selected UI element now wrap and show the full element content instead of truncating it.
- Open chat files in an edge-to-edge workspace, then collapse them back to the Files side panel without losing your place.
- Self-hosted Fleet agents can use sandbox-backed computer access without requiring a cloud billing plan tier.
- Files attached to Slack messages are now available under /workspace/uploads for sandbox-backed agents, matching files uploaded from Fleet.
- Clicking + New Agent from Workspace Agents now opens the same New agent dialog used elsewhere in Fleet, instead of the old draft editor.
- Navigating to agent chat with an agent selected no longer crashes while the agent details are still loading. The chat shows a loading state until the agent is ready, then renders normally.
- Sandbox-backed Fleet agents can create or revise downloadable DOCX files without installing an authoring package during the task. A built-in skill guides document authoring and structural validation.
- The Configure panel is now enabled for everyone, so it always shows up beside the chat when you open an agent.
- Fleet now resolves AWS IAM roles only for Bedrock models, so loading OpenAI and other provider secrets no longer waits on AWS STS.
- The new agent creation experience is now enabled for everyone. Asking the assistant for an agent surfaces the Create agent button, and the new agent runs its own setup conversation instead of being built inline.
- A conversation whose stored state grew past the API's usual single-response size limit now loads in full, up to 32 MiB, instead of failing. The response marks the conversation as oversized, and updates to it still fail until its state shrinks.
- Sandbox-backed Fleet agents can build a new deck, revise an existing one, and answer questions about the contents of a .pptx file without installing presentation tooling first. A built-in skill guides authoring and validates the file before delivery.
- Fleet agents can send workspace files to Slack channels, threads, and direct messages using slack_send_file and slack_send_file_to_user.
- Polly now resolves AWS IAM roles only for Bedrock models, so loading other provider secrets no longer waits on AWS STS.
- Fleet agents now correctly route sandbox creation and org config requests to the Go platform-backend service on self-hosted deployments where the Go and Python services run on separate addresses, eliminating the need for a reverse-proxy workaround.
- While an agent works on a turn, the chat now shows a live elapsed-time count that appears after a couple of seconds and picks up a rotating status label on longer waits, so a slow turn reads as in progress rather than stalled. Models that stream reasoning still collapse to the time they spent thinking once the answer arrives.
- When an agent reads a file its model cannot accept as an attachment, Fleet now substitutes a short explanation instead of failing the request. Conversations that previously became stuck recover on their next message.
- Sandbox-backed Fleet agents can create spreadsheets, revise existing workbooks, and answer questions about .xlsx and .xlsm files without installing spreadsheet tooling first. A built-in skill guides safe openpyxl usage and validates each workbook before delivery.
- Sandbox-backed Fleet agents can convert legacy Office, OpenDocument, RTF, EPUB, and text-based PDF files to Markdown for reading and extraction. A built-in skill guides modern Office files and directly supported PDFs to their existing workflows.
- Fleet now uses the selected user identity for GitHub requests that are not tied to a specific repository.
- Fleet agents can now work with Google Drive; searching, organizing, sharing, and inspecting files; and gain additional Sheets, Slides, Docs, Calendar, Gmail, and Meet actions such as replying to and forwarding email, responding to invitations, and checking free/busy times.
- Connecting Google now grants Fleet agents access to your own Docs, Sheets, and Slides, not only files the agent created itself. Existing connections keep working unchanged; reconnect Google from the Integrations page to grant the wider access.
- Create a Fleet skill from a local folder while preserving its SKILL.md and supporting files.
- Deployment creation errors now show the deletion schedule and explain how to reuse a retained tracing project name.
- You can now attach .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx files in chat without giving the agent a sandbox. Models that accept document input, such as OpenAI and Gemini, read the file directly.
- Sandbox-backed Fleet agents now treat PPT requests as PowerPoint deliverables and create .pptx files instead of HTML presentations.
- Fleet now displays selected artifact elements as feedback chips while messages are queued during an active run.
- Custom Slack apps can optionally subscribe to all new channel messages instead of only @mentions. When enabled, the agent receives each message and replies only when helpful.
- Skill folder uploads now accept up to 500 files, matching what the API supports, and report progress while reading. Folders that are too large or contain non-text files are rejected up front with the specific files named.
- Connecting an OAuth account with the same account label now updates the existing Fleet connection instead of creating a duplicate. Accounts with different labels remain separate connections.
- Deleting a Fleet agent now also deletes all conversation threads and runs associated with that agent.
- Models in Fleet usage reports now sort correctly by cost, including models with no recorded cost.
- Read-only agents now keep the Configure entry point available after the panel is closed, so users can return to agent details and cloning.
- The Teams reply to channel tool now asks for approval by default, matching the other Teams write tools. Agents that already set this tool to run automatically keep their current behavior, and you can switch it back to Auto per agent.
- Agent Builder now shows actionable workspace-secret loading failures with retry guidance while preserving existing missing-key prompts.
- Fleet agents can browse their OneDrive files, download and update documents, upload files, rename files, and create sharing links.
- Fleet agents can list direct Outlook attachments and discover linked OneDrive or SharePoint files in message bodies.
- Fleet agents can forward an email to new recipients with an optional comment, and move a message into another folder. Both ask for approval first.
- Fleet agents can list a mailbox's folders, including nested ones, and scope an email search to a single folder instead of the whole mailbox.
- Deleting an agent completes cleanly and removes the agent's files along with it. Previously the delete could return a permission error after the agent had already disappeared from the agent list.
- Fleet can now load agent Prompt Hub directories up to 25 MiB, allowing agents with larger memory and file trees to remain accessible.
- Self-hosted deployments can set FLEET_SCHEDULES_ENABLED=false so agents never create or propose recurring runs. The schedule tools are unbound and the scheduling steps are dropped from agent prompts and setup.
- Runs started through the Fleet API are attributed to the user whose credential invoked them, instead of grouping together under a blank user in the usage breakdown.
- OneDrive tools now return exact drive-relative item paths and reuse them for downloads and updates. This reduces file-not-found errors caused by opaque item references.
- Fleet validates Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files before uploading them to OneDrive or SharePoint. Valid Office files stored as base64 text are repaired automatically so they upload without corruption.
- Fleet skill get, create, and update operations now resolve external OIDC users correctly while preserving workspace permissions.
- Fleet agents can download direct Outlook attachments and linked OneDrive or SharePoint files into sandbox or state-backed workspaces.
- Fleet agents materialize Outlook downloads as state files and show a compact download control in chat.
- Files shared with a Fleet agent in Slack are no longer turned away by type. Spreadsheets, documents, presentations, archives, and other binaries now reach the agent the same way they already do in the Fleet chat UI.
- Fleet computer access now follows the deployment's existing sandbox enablement setting. Self-hosted deployments without sandbox support remain disabled by default.
- Outlook tools can send emails or create drafts with files from the agent workspace, including StateBackend and sandbox-backed agents.
- Saved schedules now display a text Active or Paused badge alongside the icon, making a schedule's state clearer and more accessible.
- Claude Sonnet 5 is now available as a directly selectable Anthropic model in Fleet and Agent Builder, with adaptive thinking enabled.
- GET /v1/fleet/users lists and searches the members of your workspace by email or name, returning the user ID that agent sharing takes. API-only Fleet clients no longer need a user ID from elsewhere before sharing an agent.
- Managed Deep Agent channel setup now accepts LangSmith API keys and bearer tokens while enforcing workspace secret and deployment permissions before provisioning.
- Deployments can now have the general-purpose agent build a new agent directly in the chat, writing its name, description, tools, triggers, and instructions, instead of showing a Create agent button that hands setup to the new agent. Set FLEET_INLINE_AGENT_GENERATION on the Fleet API server, the Fleet queue, and the platform backend to turn it on. Off by default.
- POST /v1/fleet/sandboxes creates a sandbox from a snapshot and returns it ready to use, so a headless client on external OIDC can provision one without reaching for the platform sandboxes API. Choose the boot image with snapshot_id or a name:tag reference, or omit both for the workspace default.
- DELETE /v1/fleet/sandboxes/{sandbox_slug} removes one sandbox, so a headless client on external OIDC can clean up a sandbox without reaching for the platform sandboxes API. It is idempotent; deleting a sandbox that is already gone still returns 204; and the sandbox is torn down in the background, so a read taken right after shows it in a deleting state rather than absent.
- GET /v1/fleet/sandboxes/{sandbox_slug}/files/content returns the raw bytes of a file in a sandbox. Byte ranges are supported via the Range header, and HEAD reports a file's size without transferring it.
- POST /v1/fleet/sandboxes/{sandbox_slug}/files writes a file into a sandbox from a multipart/form-data body, completing the Fleet file API alongside the existing list and read endpoints. The path query parameter names the destination on its own, so the upload no longer depends on reaching a sandbox's dataplane URL directly. Files are streamed rather than buffered, and files larger than 100 megabytes are refused with 413.
- GET /v1/fleet/sandboxes/{sandbox_slug}/files returns the files under a path in a sandbox, matched by a glob pattern and paged with page_size and an opaque cursor. Paging replaces the silent result cap the sandbox glob applied, so a large directory can be read in full instead of stopping partway.
- DELETE /v1/fleet/sandbox-snapshots/{snapshot_id} removes a sandbox snapshot, which pairs with snapshot creation for the delete-then-recreate retry after a failed build. It is idempotent, and returns 409 while any sandbox is still booted from the snapshot, including a stopped one.
- GET /v1/fleet/sandbox-snapshots/{snapshot_id} returns one sandbox snapshot, so a client can watch a snapshot's build status without re-reading the whole list. The path parameter accepts a snapshot id or a Docker-style reference, where a bare name means name:latest.
- Fleet usage charts now display spend, tool, and model data instead of appearing blank.
- GET /v1/fleet/users now works for Fleet deployments authenticating through an external OIDC provider, not only for API-key callers. Headless clients on OIDC can resolve a colleague's user ID for agent sharing.
- Self-hosted Fleet can attach access profiles whose callback URLs use Kubernetes-internal service names when the deployment enables internal Kubernetes destinations.

- The [Access Profiles](/langsmith/fleet/computer-use) dialog in chat now includes a Create an access profile link that opens the sandboxes create flow, so you can add a profile when a workspace has none configured instead of hitting a dead end.
- Fleet agents can now delete files from their memory and [skills](/langsmith/fleet/skills) using the new delete tool, including files in linked workspace skills. Core agent files and read-only system skills remain protected.
- Fleet now completes OAuth for [MCP servers](/langsmith/fleet/remote-mcp-servers) whose authorization server requires client-secret authentication at the token endpoint, so connecting these servers no longer fails after the consent step.
- First-time Fleet users now see a streamlined welcome modal with two clear paths (describe an agent to build with AI, starting from a prompt in Chat, or start from a curated template), replacing the previous multi-step setup wizard.
- Creating an agent from a Fleet [template](/langsmith/fleet/templates) now skips the setup wizard and opens the agent editor with the template onboarding card.
- Fleet now sends the MCP protocol version a server negotiates during the handshake, both when loading tools and when the agent calls them, so MCP servers that require a newer version no longer return zero tools or fail tool calls.
- Fleet agents receive the day of week alongside the current date (for example "Monday, June 29th 2026"), so scheduling and date reasoning no longer relies on the model inferring the weekday from the ISO date.
- File edits in Fleet agent chat now render as syntax-highlighted, line-by-line diffs, making changes easier to review.
- Fleet agents can now read files shared with them in [Slack](/langsmith/fleet/slack-app). Attach an image, PDF, audio, video, or text file in a mention or DM and the agent ingests it into the conversation.
- On the Agent Builder Integrations page, searching now selects the All tab so results span every category, and switching category tabs clears the search.
- When you connect a custom [Slack](/langsmith/fleet/slack-app) bot to a Fleet agent, Fleet sends the installer a direct message with quick setup tips, including how to add the bot to channels and mention it with @.
- Fleet agents now have a Slack tool for listing channels the connected bot is a member of, making it easier to discover the right channel before posting or reading messages.
- Fleet OAuth provider and integration responses now include an `owner` field (`workspace` or `platform`) so you can tell your own resources apart from built-in, platform-managed ones. The platform manager organization can now create and modify built-in OAuth providers.
- Setting up a [schedule](/langsmith/fleet/schedules) is now clearer: choose a preset (daily, weekly, monthly, or every few minutes) or enter a custom cron expression, with a live human-readable preview and inline validation as you go.
- When registering an integration OAuth provider for headless connections, `http://` redirect URIs are now accepted only for the loopback IP literals `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`. The localhost hostname is no longer accepted over `http`; use the loopback IP literal or `https`.
- The [MCP servers](/langsmith/fleet/remote-mcp-servers) settings page now scrolls when the pointer is over the servers list.
- The load previous conversations tool now writes conversation files into the attached Computer sandbox when one is enabled, so agents can inspect the downloaded history with their normal file tools.
- When a Fleet agent's subagent calls a tool that requires human approval, the approval prompt now appears in the chat instead of the run completing without it.
- The Executive Assistant template can now deliver its daily brief and answer @mentions in [Slack](/langsmith/fleet/slack-app) after you connect a Slack workspace, and both the Executive Assistant and Software Engineer templates received configuration fixes.
- You can now type and send a message in agent chat while a human-in-the-loop prompt is pending. Sending a new message dismisses the pending request and continues the conversation instead of leaving the composer locked.
- Empty sections in the agent configuration panel (Channels, Connections, Skills, Schedules, Instructions, and Subagents) now explain what each one is for and what you can add before you connect anything.
- Creating a new agent no longer fails with a contentBlocks.push error when the chat stream returns string message content.
- Opening an agent in the chat inbox no longer issues repeated duplicate background requests while choosing which thread to open, reducing flicker.
- Fleet agents now load your workspace's private [skills](/langsmith/fleet/skills). Previously, in workspaces with fine-grained access controls, an agent could start with only public skills available.
- Reloading an agent chat page no longer flashes the thread list through loading and loaded states multiple times. The sidebar now waits for agent scope to finish loading before fetching threads, so the list settles once.
- GitHub App installations now sync through the authenticated LangSmith session after installation completes, keeping workspace linking aligned with the active user.
- OAuth providers now accept an optional default redirect URI (`default_redirect_uri`). When set, headless OAuth flows for that provider return the authorization code to it instead of the LangSmith callback, without passing a redirect on every request. The value is validated against the provider's allowed redirect URIs.
- Fleet agents now discover tools with find_tools or an /tools listing before opening a tool's reference doc, so they no longer waste a turn reading guessed tool filenames that do not exist.
- The Fleet Fast model tier (`gpt-5.4-mini`) now runs at medium reasoning effort instead of low, improving response quality on harder tasks.
- The [templates](/langsmith/fleet/templates) gallery now features the Executive Assistant and Software Engineer templates as large cards with a hero illustration, each showing the agent's own icon.
- Each tool inside a connection in the agent Configure panel now has a remove action (a trash button revealed on hover, matching the connection remove) instead of an on/off switch. The switch implied a reversible toggle, but turning a tool off actually removed it from the agent, so the control now reflects what it does.
- Sending a chat message while clarifying questions were pending could fail the run and leave the thread stuck. Free-text now correctly dismisses the pending request before continuing.
- In the Agent Builder chat, the Skills block's "Add skill" menu now opens the browse-workspace, create-skill, and import-from-URL dialogs. Previously choosing an option changed the URL but nothing appeared.
- Opening an agent in Fleet now always starts a new chat instead of jumping into a recent thread. Past conversations remain available in the thread sidebar.
- When an agent created from a template introduces itself, it writes what it learns straight to its own memory instead of pausing for approval on every file. Memory writes in your other threads still ask first.
- Skill descriptions containing quotes, colons, or multiple lines are now parsed and stored correctly, and importing or editing a skill preserves all of its frontmatter instead of dropping fields like license or allowed-tools.
- The Add connection dialog now groups Arcade MCP servers under a dedicated Arcade section, so they are easy to find instead of being listed under Other.
- The Fleet model picker now groups served, LCU-billed models (Fast, Pro, Max) separately from bring-your-own models billed per run, making the pricing model for each option clearer.
- The compact Fast/Pro/Max model picker in Agent Builder now shows the model icon on its closed trigger, matching the full model picker.
- When an organization reaches its monthly Fleet usage limit, the error now directs users to upgrade their plan to continue.

## New features

- You can now add any agent to [Slack](/langsmith/fleet/slack-app) in one click. After you authenticate with Slack once, Fleet automatically creates a Slack app configured with the agent's name, description, and icon, and maps each agent to a single Slack app.
- When an agent is first added to a Slack workspace, it sends the creator a direct message with tips for inviting it to channels and mentioning it.
- Agents now raise tool approvals directly in [Slack](/langsmith/fleet/slack-app), with Approve and Deny buttons in the thread, so you no longer need to switch to the Fleet UI to respond.
- When an agent encounters an error during a run, it now replies in the Slack thread instead of going silent. Authentication errors and some other error types include more detail.
- Agents can now read file attachments in [Slack](/langsmith/fleet/slack-app) messages.
- The agent editor is now a sidebar built into the agent chat page, which organizes configuration into Channels, Connections, Knowledge, Schedule, and Advanced settings drawers.
- The agent creation experience now starts from a blank-slate agent that configures itself and pauses at key points to bring you into the process.
