# Encryption at rest

Choose between built-in AES encryption and custom encryption handlers for Agent Server data.

Agent Server supports two approaches to application-level encryption at rest. Use built-in AES encryption unless you need per-tenant keys or an external key management system.

## Choose an encryption approach

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Built-in AES encryption" icon="shield-lock" href="/langsmith/aes-encryption">
    Recommended for most deployments. Configure an AES key to encrypt checkpoint data and selected JSON fields. Supports lazy key rotation.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Custom encryption" icon="settings-code" href="/langsmith/custom-encryption">
    Use only when built-in AES does not meet your requirements. Supports per-tenant keys and external key management systems through custom handlers.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Choose [built-in AES encryption](/langsmith/aes-encryption) if you need:

* One encryption key for the deployment
* Key rotation
* Selective encryption of JSON fields

Choose [custom encryption](/langsmith/custom-encryption) only if you need:

* Different encryption keys for different tenants
* An external key management system
* Custom encryption logic or audit behavior
