# Hybrid

A LangSmith Deployment setup where you self-host Agent Servers in your infrastructure and send traces to LangSmith Cloud or a self-hosted LangSmith instance.

Hybrid is a platform setup for [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployment), which **deploys and runs agents in production**.

In a hybrid platform setup, you self-host [Agent Servers](/langsmith/agent-server) in your own infrastructure and send their traces to LangSmith, where LangSmith can be either a [self-hosted](/langsmith/self-hosted) instance or [LangSmith Cloud](/langsmith/cloud).

This setup gives you control over where your agent workloads run while letting you choose the [LangSmith platform option](/langsmith/platform-setup) that best fits your observability and compliance requirements.

<Note>
  Hybrid is a platform setup for LangSmith Deployment (agent serving). To set up LangSmith for observability, evaluation, and prompt engineering only, see [Set up LangSmith](/langsmith/platform-setup).

## Workflow

1. Build and test your agent locally.
2. Deploy your agent to an [Agent Server running in your infrastructure](#self-host-your-agent-servers).
3. Send the agent's traces to [LangSmith (self-hosted or SaaS) for observability and evaluation](#choose-where-traces-are-sent).

### Self-host your Agent Servers

Deploy standalone Agent Servers using Docker, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes. See the [standalone server guide](/langsmith/deploy-standalone-server) for prerequisites, environment variables, and platform-specific instructions.

### Choose where traces are sent

Agent Servers send traces to LangSmith based on the `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` environment variable:

* **LangSmith SaaS**: Omit `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` to use the default (GCP US), or set it to the endpoint for your region:

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Region</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>GCP US</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>GCP EU</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>GCP APAC</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>AWS US</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

* **Self-hosted LangSmith**: Set `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` to the hostname of your [self-hosted LangSmith](/langsmith/self-hosted) instance.

In both cases, authenticate with a [LangSmith API key](/langsmith/create-account-api-key) issued by the LangSmith instance you are tracing to.
