# Add a sandbox to Managed Deep Agents

Agents often want to write or execute code when doing their job.
A sandbox gives a managed deep agent an isolated filesystem and shell for working with files, running code, and executing commands.

<Note>
Managed Deep Agents is in **public [beta](/langsmith/release-stages)** and available on [LangSmith Cloud](/langsmith/cloud) in the US region only.
</Note>

## Project structure

Keep the agent entry point at the project root and the sandbox declaration under `sandbox/`. Add `sandbox/setup.sh` only if you want to provision a snapshot:



```text
my-agent/
  agent.ts
  sandbox/
    index.ts
    setup.sh   # optional
```


## Configure a sandbox

`mda init` scaffolds a sandbox declaration. Managed Deep Agents enables the sandbox only while the `sandbox/` directory is present. Delete the directory to opt out, such as for an agent that only needs its prompt, memory, and tools.

`mda init` does not create `setup.sh`. Add that file yourself if the snapshot should install packages, clone a tree, or otherwise change the image.

Managed Deep Agents uses [LangSmith Sandboxes](/langsmith/sandboxes) for this backend. Reuse is always one sandbox per durable thread.



Declare the sandbox with `defineSandbox`:

```ts sandbox/index.ts
import { defineSandbox } from "managed-deepagents";

export const sandbox = defineSandbox({
  idleTtlSeconds: 600,
  defaultTimeout: 600,
});
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `idleTtlSeconds` | `600` | Seconds of inactivity before the sandbox and its contents are deleted. Deletion is not recoverable. |
| `defaultTimeout` | `600` | Seconds allowed for each command. |


## Provision a snapshot

If `sandbox/setup.sh` exists, `mda deploy` and `mda dev` run the script once and save the resulting environment as a snapshot. Modifications from that run, such as cloned repositories and installed packages, persist in the snapshot. New threads clone that snapshot instead of running `setup.sh`. The snapshot is reused until `setup.sh` changes, at which point it is rebuilt.

The script runs with `bash -e`. A non-zero exit fails the snapshot and the deploy or `mda dev` session. LangSmith does not update the live deployment to the failed snapshot. Any previously successful snapshot continues to serve.

```bash sandbox/setup.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

apt-get update && apt-get install -y jq
mkdir -p /workspace
```

Project `.env` values that deploy forwards are available as environment variables when `setup.sh` runs, for example a token used to clone a private repo. Thread sandboxes that clone the snapshot do not inherit those variables. Do not write secrets onto the filesystem while `setup.sh` runs; anything on disk is part of every thread's image.

Editing `setup.sh` and redeploying does not wipe `/workspace` on live threads. Those boxes keep the files they already have. A new thread clones the new snapshot.

## Choose a bake base

With no bake base, LangSmith's default sandbox template is the starting point. To start from something else, set exactly one of these:



| Option | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `snapshotName` | LangSmith snapshot name. Tags are allowed. |
| `snapshotId` | LangSmith snapshot id. |
| `dockerImage` | Published Docker image. |

```ts sandbox/index.ts
import { defineSandbox } from "managed-deepagents";

export const sandbox = defineSandbox({
  idleTtlSeconds: 600,
  dockerImage: "python:3.12-slim",
});
```


For a private image, pass the image and a `registry`. Managed Deep Agents creates or updates a deployment-owned Host registry at bake time. Only the variable name is compiled; the credential value does not enter the build or the snapshot.



Name the password in `passwordEnv`:

```ts sandbox/index.ts
import { defineSandbox } from "managed-deepagents";

export const sandbox = defineSandbox({
  dockerImage: "ghcr.io/acme/agent-base:1",
  registry: {
    url: "ghcr.io",
    username: "octocat",
    passwordEnv: "GHCR_TOKEN",
  },
});
```


Put `GHCR_TOKEN` in the project `.env` or the process environment. After bake, Managed Deep Agents does not forward that value to the running Agent Server.

## How the agent uses the sandbox

The agent uses filesystem tools such as `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `delete`, `glob`, and `grep`, and runs shell commands with `execute`. Use `instructions.md` to specify where the agent should work and what it must not modify.

## Sandbox lifecycle

Managed Deep Agents owns sandbox naming, recipe bake, reuse, recovery, and cleanup. Each durable thread gets its own sandbox, cloned from the current recipe snapshot.

`mda delete` removes the managed sandboxes for the deployment, the `{deployment}--setup-*` recipe snapshots, and the deployment-owned registry when one exists. For platform-level lifecycle details, see [Sandboxes](/langsmith/sandboxes).
