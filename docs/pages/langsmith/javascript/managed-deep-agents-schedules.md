# Add schedules to Managed Deep Agents

Declare managed cron schedules for Managed Deep Agents deployments, or create them at runtime.

Managed Deep Agents can run agents on a cron schedule. When you deploy the project, `mda deploy` provisions each schedule as a LangSmith cron after the deployment is live.

<Note>
  Managed Deep Agents is in **public [beta](/langsmith/release-stages)** on [LangSmith Cloud](/langsmith/cloud).
</Note>

## Project structure

Schedule declarations live in the project-level `schedules/` directory, with one schedule per file:

```text theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
my-agent/
  agent.ts
  schedules/
    daily-digest.ts
```

## Add a schedule

The file name becomes the managed schedule name.

The schedule module must export a named `schedule` declaration.

```ts schedules/daily-digest.ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import { defineSchedule } from "managed-deepagents";

export const schedule = defineSchedule({
  cron: "0 8 * * 1-5",
  timezone: "America/Los_Angeles",
  prompt: "Write the daily digest.",
});
```

## Configure schedule input

Each schedule must define exactly one of:

* `prompt`: A natural-language prompt. Managed Deep Agents converts it to a user message when the cron fires.
* `input`: A structured LangGraph input object. Use this when you need to pass custom graph input instead of a single prompt.

```ts schedules/nightly-sweep.ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import { defineSchedule } from "managed-deepagents";

export const schedule = defineSchedule({
  cron: "30 2 * * *",
  input: {
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: "Sweep stale tickets and summarize changes." },
    ],
  },
});
```

`cron` must be a standard five-field cron expression: minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week. If `timezone` is omitted, LangSmith crons use UTC.

## Choose thread behavior

Schedules use ephemeral threads by default. Managed Deep Agents creates a fresh thread for each run and asks LangSmith to delete that temporary thread after the run completes.

Use a persistent thread only when scheduled runs should accumulate durable thread state across invocations.

A persistent thread ID must be the UUID of a thread that already exists on the deployment. Managed Deep Agents passes the value straight to the Agent Server, which rejects any ID that is not a UUID.

### Create the persistent thread

Create the thread before you deploy the schedule. Open the deployment in [LangSmith Studio](/langsmith/studio), create a new thread, and copy its thread ID. `mda deploy` prints the deployment URL, and LangSmith lists it on the deployment page.

Neither Managed Deep Agents nor the `mda` CLI creates the thread, so this is a one-time manual step for each persistent schedule.

### Declare the persistent schedule

Use that thread ID in the schedule declaration.

<Note>
  The following example requires [durable memory](/langsmith/javascript/managed-deep-agents-memory).
</Note>

```ts schedules/nightly-memory.ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import { defineSchedule } from "managed-deepagents";

export const schedule = defineSchedule({
  cron: "0 3 * * *",
  prompt: "Review the current project memory and list follow-up tasks.",
  thread: { mode: "persistent", id: "<thread-uuid>" },
});
```

## Deliver results to Slack

Set `deliverTo` to post the final response through a configured [Slack channel](/langsmith/javascript/managed-deep-agents-channels-slack).

Use a Slack channel ID because scheduled runs have no originating thread.

<Note>
  Schedule delivery requires `managed-deepagents` version 0.4.0 or later.
</Note>

```ts schedules/monday-greeting.ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import { defineSchedule } from "managed-deepagents";

export const schedule = defineSchedule({
  cron: "0 9 * * 1",
  prompt: "Write a short Monday greeting.",
  deliverTo: {
    channel: "slack",
    to: {
      type: "provider_conversation",
      conversationId: "C0123456789",
    },
  },
});
```

The Slack bot must have access to the destination.

## Use static declarations

Schedule declarations are extracted at compile time. Keep schedule configuration statically serializable:

* Use literals, arrays, objects, and references to top-level literal constants.

* Do not read environment variables, call functions, spread objects, or compute schedule values dynamically.

* Put dynamic behavior in the agent, tools, middleware, or runtime context instead.

## Test schedules locally

`mda dev` compiles `schedules/` and lists each schedule in its startup banner, but it does not provision them. Schedules run only on a deployment.

<Warning>
  Schedules never fire under `mda dev`. The local server reports no error, so a schedule that is listed at startup is still inactive.
</Warning>

To test the agent behavior a schedule triggers, send the schedule's `prompt` or `input` to the agent directly in local Studio. To test the schedule itself, deploy the project to a development deployment.

## Deploy schedules

Test the project locally with [`mda dev`](/langsmith/javascript/managed-deep-agents-cli#develop-locally), then deploy it with [`mda deploy`](/langsmith/javascript/managed-deep-agents-deploy). Open deployment traces in LangSmith to inspect model calls, tool calls, errors, and latency.

When the deployment reaches `DEPLOYED`, `mda deploy` deletes the cron jobs that earlier `schedules/` declarations created and creates cron jobs for the current declarations. Removing a local schedule file and redeploying removes the corresponding managed cron. Schedules created at runtime are unaffected.

<Warning>
  If you deploy with `--no-wait`, the CLI triggers the remote build and exits before the deployment reaches `DEPLOYED`, so it does not reconcile schedules during that invocation. Run `mda deploy` without `--no-wait` when adding, changing, or removing schedules.
</Warning>

## Create schedules at runtime

<Note>
  Runtime schedules require `managed-deepagents` 0.9.0 or later.
</Note>

Declarations in `schedules/` are fixed when you deploy. The `schedules` API creates schedules while the agent runs, so the agent can set up recurring or one-time work in response to a conversation. Call it from a tool or from [middleware](/langsmith/javascript/managed-deep-agents-middleware). Each schedule belongs to the current user or to the agent.

The agent reaches this API only through tools that you write. Expose the calls the agent needs, and leave out the ones it should not reach.

When a tool creates a schedule during a [channel](/langsmith/javascript/managed-deep-agents-channels) run, such as a Slack conversation, the schedule inherits that channel. Each run posts its final answer back to it. A new thread posts a new Slack message, and the current thread replies in the existing Slack thread.

`newThread` decides which of the two a schedule uses.

### Create a recurring schedule

`remind_me` gives the agent a way to set up a recurring reminder for the person it is talking to. The agent calls it with the prompt to run and a cron expression for how often to run it. Each time the cron fires, a new run starts with that prompt as its user message. The agent decides what each scheduled run is asked to do.

```ts tools/schedules.ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import { tool } from "langchain";
import { z } from "zod";
import { schedules } from "managed-deepagents";

export const remindMe = tool(
  async ({ prompt, cron, timezone }) => {
    const item = await schedules.create({
      owner: { type: "user" },
      cron,
      timezone,
      prompt,
    });
    return `Created schedule ${item.id}.`;
  },
  {
    name: "remind_me",
    description: "Run a prompt for the current user on a cron schedule.",
    schema: z.object({
      prompt: z.string(),
      cron: z.string(),
      timezone: z.string().default("UTC"),
    }),
  },
);
```

Asked in Slack to send a standup reminder every weekday, the agent calls `remind_me`. It passes a prompt of its own wording and the cron `0 9 * * 1-5`. Each weekday run posts its answer to that Slack conversation as a new message, because `cron` schedules default to a new thread.

### Create a one-time schedule

Pass `at` in place of `cron` for work that runs once. `follow_up_later` gives the agent a way to set a single follow-up, such as checking a deploy after it finishes.

```ts tools/follow-up.ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import { tool } from "langchain";
import { z } from "zod";
import { schedules } from "managed-deepagents";

export const followUpLater = tool(
  async ({ prompt, hours }) => {
    const item = await schedules.create({
      owner: { type: "user" },
      at: new Date(Date.now() + hours * 60 * 60_000),
      prompt,
    });
    return `Scheduled a one-time follow-up: ${item.id}.`;
  },
  {
    name: "follow_up_later",
    description: "Run a prompt once, a number of hours from now.",
    schema: z.object({
      prompt: z.string(),
      hours: z.number(),
    }),
  },
);
```

A one-time schedule defaults to the current thread, so its run continues the conversation that created it and replies in the same Slack thread.

### Create options

<ParamField type="object">
  `{ type: "user" }` selects the authenticated person of the current run, and the schedule runs as that person. An optional `id` must match that person. `{ type: "agent" }` selects the schedules the agent owns, which run as the agent's service identity.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  A five-field cron expression for a recurring schedule. Give exactly one of `cron` and `at`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="Date | string">
  A `Date`, or an ISO 8601 timestamp that ends with `Z` or a UTC offset. The schedule runs once. The runtime rounds it up to the next whole minute. It must be at least one minute and at most 365 days in the future.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  An IANA time zone for `cron`, such as `America/Los_Angeles`. Do not pass it with `at`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="string">
  A prompt that each run receives as a user message. Give exactly one of `prompt` and `input`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="object | object[]">
  A structured LangGraph input for each run.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="boolean">
  `true` starts each run on a new thread. `false` continues the current thread. Defaults to `true` with `cron` and `false` with `at`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="boolean">
  Create the schedule without running it.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="object">
  JSON metadata for your own use. Keys that start with `mda_` are reserved.
</ParamField>

### Manage schedules

`list`, `get`, `update`, and `delete` cover the rest of a schedule's life. Expose them as tools when the agent should manage the schedules it created. An agent with `list` and `delete` can answer "what reminders do I have?" and cancel one on request. Pause a schedule with `update` instead of deleting it when the person wants it back later.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
const owner = { type: "user" } as const;

const page = await schedules.list({ owner, limit: 20 });
const item = await schedules.get(page.items[0].id, { owner });
await schedules.update(item.id, { paused: true }, { owner });
await schedules.delete(item.id, { owner });
```

`update` accepts `cron`, `at`, `timezone`, `prompt`, `input`, `paused`, and `metadata`. The channel and the thread choice are fixed at creation. `list` hides expired one-time schedules unless you pass `includeExpired: true`. For the agent owner, `list` and `get` also return the schedules in `schedules/`, which you change in code.

## Troubleshoot schedules

* `must export a named schedule declaration`: Export a top-level `schedule` from each file in `schedules/`.

* `must define exactly one of prompt or input`: Add either `prompt` or `input`, but not both.

* `cron must be a standard 5-field expression`: Use five cron fields, not seconds-based cron syntax.

* `schedule is not static`: Replace computed values with literals or top-level literal constants.

* `failed to create cron for schedule`: Open the deployment URL in LangSmith and confirm the deployed Agent Server is healthy.

* `Invalid thread ID: must be a UUID (HTTP 422)`: A persistent schedule declares a thread ID that is not a UUID. Replace it with the UUID of an existing thread. See [Choose thread behavior](#choose-thread-behavior).

* **A schedule does not run during local development**: `mda dev` does not provision schedules. See [Test schedules locally](#test-schedules-locally).
