# LLM Gateway

Access models across providers with one LangSmith API key while tracing calls and enforcing spend and data-protection policies.

Use one [LangSmith API key](/langsmith/create-account-api-key) to call models across configured providers. Switch providers by changing the model ID, while the LLM Gateway traces every model call and applies centralized governance policies.

<Note>
  **Beta:** The LLM Gateway is in [beta](/langsmith/release-stages).
</Note>

## What the gateway provides

* **One key, multiple providers:** Developers authenticate with a LangSmith API key instead of storing provider keys locally.
* **One request format, multiple models:** Use Chat Completions, Messages, or Responses with models across configured providers.
* **Built-in observability:** Every gateway call appears as a [LangSmith trace](/langsmith/llm-gateway-access).
* **Central governance:** Apply [spend limits](/langsmith/llm-gateway-spend-policies), [rate limits](/langsmith/llm-gateway-rate-limit-policies), and [data policies](/langsmith/llm-gateway-data-policy).

## See what a request looks like

Once an administrator has [completed the setup](/langsmith/llm-gateway-admin-setup), a gateway call is a standard Chat Completions request authenticated with a workspace-scoped LangSmith API key. This example calls the US gateway on LangSmith Cloud and assumes the workspace has an Anthropic provider secret:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="lsv2_..._....cbed3e"

curl https://gateway.smith.langchain.com/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $LANGSMITH_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

A `200` response confirms that the gateway, your LangSmith API key, permissions, and the selected provider secret are configured correctly. To make this request yourself in cURL, Python, TypeScript, or Deep Agents, follow the [quickstart](/langsmith/llm-gateway-quickstart).

## Use the standard API

Choose the request format already used by your application. The format does not limit which configured provider you can call.

| API format | Endpoint |
| - | - |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | `POST /v1/chat/completions` |
| Anthropic Messages | `POST /v1/messages` |
| OpenAI Responses | `POST /v1/responses` |

Set `model` to a provider-prefixed bring-your-own-key ID such as `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`, `anthropic/claude-opus-5`, or `azure/<deployment-name>`, or use a [Gateway Credits](/langsmith/llm-gateway-credits) model slug such as `moonshotai/kimi-k3`. The model ID determines the upstream route. When the selected provider uses a different native format, the gateway translates the request and response.

The gateway runs on LangSmith Cloud in every region, on [BYOC](/langsmith/byoc), and on [self-hosted](/langsmith/self-hosted) LangSmith. On BYOC and self-hosted, the same paths sit behind the `/gateway` prefix, such as `POST /gateway/v1/chat/completions`. For the hostname to use in each case, see [Check availability](/langsmith/llm-gateway-how-it-works#check-availability). Self-hosted installations also need an administrator to [enable the gateway in the Helm chart](/langsmith/llm-gateway-self-hosted).

For base URLs, examples, and translation behavior, see [API formats](/langsmith/llm-gateway-api-formats).

## Choose how credentials are managed

| Option | Upstream credential | Setup and billing |
| - | - | - |
| Bring your own provider account | An administrator stores the provider key in workspace [Provider Secrets](/langsmith/llm-gateway-admin-setup#1-add-provider-secrets). | The provider bills usage to your provider account. |
| [Gateway Credits](/langsmith/llm-gateway-credits) | LangChain owns the upstream credential. | No provider secret is required. Invocations are billed to your LangSmith account. |

<Tip>
  Need to use the gateway with prompts stored in the Prompt Hub? See [Prompt Hub with the gateway](/langsmith/manage-prompts-programmatically#use-with-the-langsmith-gateway) for how to route Prompt Hub model calls through the gateway using two environment variables.

  Need provider-native request and response behavior? Use [Direct model access](/langsmith/llm-gateway-direct-model-access) to bypass the standardization layer. This is an advanced alternative to the standard API.
