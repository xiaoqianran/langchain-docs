# Manage a deployment

Configure the repository, branch, and automatic updates for a LangSmith Cloud deployment, or delete it.

Manage the repository, branch, and automatic update settings for a Cloud deployment. You can also delete a deployment when you no longer need it.

## Configure deployment settings

To configure deployment settings:

1. From the **Deployments** view, select a deployment.
2. In the top-right corner, select the gear icon (**Deployment Settings**).
3. (Optional) To build from a different GitHub repository, select **Change repository** and choose the repository. For details, see [Change the repository](#change-the-repository).
4. Update the **Git Branch** as needed.
5. Enable or disable **Automatically update deployment on push to branch**.

Branch and tag creation or deletion events do not trigger revisions. Only pushes to an existing branch trigger an update.

When several pushes occur in quick succession, LangSmith queues the updates. After the current build completes, LangSmith builds the most recent commit and skips the other queued commits.

### Change the repository

Change the repository after you rename it, transfer it to another GitHub account, or move your agent to a different repository. LangSmith checks that the `hosted-langserve` GitHub app can access the repository and that the repository contains the deployment's configuration file on its Git branch. Saving does not create a revision; the next revision builds from the new repository.

If you transferred the repository to another GitHub account, first [give the app access to it](/langsmith/deploy-to-cloud#manage-github-repository-access).

To change the repository through the API, send `source_config.repo_url` in a `PATCH /v2/deployments/{deployment_id}` request. For more information, see the [Control plane API reference](/langsmith/api-ref-control-plane).

## Delete a deployment

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="LangSmith UI">
    To delete a deployment:

    1. From the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com?utm_source=docs\&utm_medium=cta\&utm_campaign=langsmith-signup\&utm_content=langsmith-manage-deployment), select **Deployments**.
    2. Select the menu icon for the deployment, then select **Delete**.
    3. In the confirmation modal, select **Delete**.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="LangGraph CLI">
    To find the deployment ID, run:

    ```shell theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
    langgraph deploy list
    ```

    Delete the deployment by ID:

    ```shell theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
    langgraph deploy delete <DEPLOYMENT_ID>
    ```

    To skip the confirmation prompt, pass `--force`:

    ```shell theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
    langgraph deploy delete --force <DEPLOYMENT_ID>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  Deletion is asynchronous. The deployment disappears from the **Deployments** view immediately, but LangSmith removes its infrastructure and metadata in stages. The deployment name might remain unavailable until deletion finishes.
