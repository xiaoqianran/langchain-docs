# Set up LangSmith

Host and manage LangSmith infrastructure for observability, evaluation, and prompt engineering.

<div>
  <div>
    <h1>Overview</h1>

    Set up **LangSmith** for [observability](/langsmith/observability), [evaluation](/langsmith/evaluation), and [prompt engineering](/langsmith/prompt-context-hub#prompts). LangSmith offers Cloud, Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC), and Self-hosted options.

    If you also want to deploy agents in production, you can use [**LangSmith Deployment**](/langsmith/deployment) with Cloud, BYOC, or Self-hosted.

    Cloud, BYOC, and Self-hosted support [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployment) for agent workloads. Refer to the [LangSmith Deployment overview](/langsmith/deployment) to pick a topology (Cloud managed, BYOC, Hybrid, self-hosted with control plane, or standalone).

    <h2>Common setups</h2>

    * **Fastest to start, managed everything.** [LangSmith Cloud](/langsmith/cloud) paired with [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployment) on Cloud. LangChain hosts the platform, and, when you use LangSmith Deployment, also hosts your [Agent Servers](/langsmith/agent-server).
    * **Bring Your Own Cloud.** Data stays in your VPC, and LangChain manages the infrastructure. Refer to the [BYOC overview](/langsmith/byoc).
    * **Observability data must stay in your infrastructure.** Self-hosted LangSmith, paired with any LangSmith Deployment topology, including [self-hosted LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deploy-with-control-plane) for agent workloads.
    * **Managed observability, agents in your VPC.** LangSmith Cloud paired with [Hybrid](/langsmith/hybrid) LangSmith Deployment. Traces and evaluations stay on SaaS while agent workloads stay in your infrastructure.
    * **Observability only, no agent hosting.** LangSmith Cloud or self-hosted, without LangSmith Deployment. Run your agents wherever you already run apps and send traces to LangSmith.
