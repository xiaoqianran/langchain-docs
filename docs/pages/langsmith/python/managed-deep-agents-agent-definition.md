# Define a Managed Deep Agent

The agent definition selects the model and core capabilities of a Managed Deep Agent.

<Note>
Managed Deep Agents is in **public [beta](/langsmith/release-stages)** and available on [LangSmith Cloud](/langsmith/cloud) in the US region only.
</Note>

## Project structure

The agent entry lives at the project root:

```text
my-agent/
  agent.py
```

Export the agent definition as a named `agent`.




## Define an agent

Use `define_deep_agent`:

<CodeGroup>
```python OpenAI
from managed_deepagents import define_deep_agent

agent = define_deep_agent(
    name="research-assistant",
    model="openai:gpt-5.5",
)
```

```python Anthropic
from managed_deepagents import define_deep_agent

agent = define_deep_agent(
    name="research-assistant",
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
)
```

```python Google Gemini
from managed_deepagents import define_deep_agent

agent = define_deep_agent(
    name="research-assistant",
    model="google_genai:gemini-3.6-flash",
)
```
</CodeGroup>




| Parameter | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`name=`](#name) | Sets the agent and default deployment name |
| [`model=`](#model) | Selects the chat model |
| [`tools=`](#tools) | Adds tools the agent can call |
| [`middleware=`](#middleware) | Adds behavior around model calls, tool calls, and the agent lifecycle |
| [`subagents=`](#subagents) | Defines specialized agents for delegated tasks |
| [`permissions=`](#permissions) | Controls path-level access for filesystem tools |
| [`interrupt_on=`](#human-in-the-loop) | Pauses before selected tool calls for human approval |
| [`response_format=`](#structured-output) | Defines a structured output schema |




## Name

`name` is required. Pass a static string that starts with a letter and contains only letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens, such as `"research-assistant"`.

Managed Deep Agents uses the name as the LangGraph assistant ID and the default LangSmith deployment name. You can override the deployment name with `mda deploy --name` without changing the agent definition.

## Model

Set `model` to the chat model the agent uses. The simplest option is a `provider:model` string. Add the provider's API key to `.env` so the model works locally and in the deployment.

<CodeGroup>
```python OpenAI
from managed_deepagents import define_deep_agent

agent = define_deep_agent(
    name="research-assistant",
    model="openai:gpt-5.5",
)
```

```python Anthropic
from managed_deepagents import define_deep_agent

agent = define_deep_agent(
    name="research-assistant",
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
)
```

```python Google Gemini
from managed_deepagents import define_deep_agent

agent = define_deep_agent(
    name="research-assistant",
    model="google_genai:gemini-3.6-flash",
)
```
</CodeGroup>




Pass a LangChain chat model instance instead when you need to configure model parameters in code. For model options and supported providers, see [Models](/oss/python/deepagents/models).

### Use LLM Gateway

You can use [LLM Gateway](/langsmith/llm-gateway) to apply rate limits, fallbacks, and other policies to model calls.

Prefix the gateway model ID with `langsmith:`:

```python
from managed_deepagents import define_deep_agent

agent = define_deep_agent(
    name="my-agent",
    model="langsmith:moonshotai/kimi-k3",
)
```




<Note>
Gateway model IDs use a slash between provider and model (`langsmith:provider/model-name`). Model strings that call a provider directly use a colon (`provider:model-name`).
</Note>

The gateway routes each request by model ID. `moonshotai/kimi-k3` is a LangChain-hosted model, so it requires no provider secret and draws on [Gateway Credits](/langsmith/llm-gateway-credits). A model ID that starts with a provider your workspace has configured, such as `anthropic/claude-opus-5`, uses that [provider secret](/langsmith/llm-gateway-admin-setup#1-add-provider-secrets) and bills to your own provider account.

For more information, see [LLM Gateway](/langsmith/llm-gateway).

## Tools

Pass tools in the `tools` list to let the agent call application logic or external services.




Define tools in local modules, import them into the agent entry, and add them to the definition. See [Custom tools](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-tools). To add tools from remote MCP servers without importing them into the agent entry, use [MCP connectors](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-mcp-connectors).

## Middleware

Pass middleware in the `middleware` list to add behavior around model calls, tool calls, and the agent lifecycle. Middleware runs in list order.




See [Custom middleware](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-middleware).

## Subagents

Pass subagent definitions in `subagents` when the agent should delegate specialized or context-heavy work. Each subagent can have its own prompt, model, and tools. See [Subagents](/oss/python/deepagents/subagents).

## Permissions

Pass filesystem permission rules in `permissions` to control which paths the agent's built-in filesystem tools can read or write. See [Permissions](/oss/python/deepagents/permissions).

## Human-in-the-loop

Set `interrupt_on` to pause before selected tool calls.




Use this for actions that require a person to approve, edit, or reject the call before it runs. See [Human-in-the-loop](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-tools#human-in-the-loop).

## Structured output

Set `response_format` when the agent must return data that matches a schema instead of an unconstrained text response.




See [Structured output](/oss/python/langchain/structured-output).

Configure the system prompt, skills, memory, sandbox, identity, channels, and schedules through their project files rather than the agent definition. See [Project structure](/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-project-structure).
