# Configure additional self-hosted features

Choose which optional self-hosted LangSmith features to install, such as Sandboxes, Engine, Fleet, and LangSmith Deployment, and in what order.

[Self-hosted LangSmith](/langsmith/self-hosted) supports optional features beyond the base installation. Complete the [Kubernetes installation](/langsmith/kubernetes) first. It already includes observability and evaluation, plus [Insights and Chat](/langsmith/self-host-insights-chat). Then follow only the guides your use case requires.

## Choose additional features

Each feature has its own setup guide. Follow only the guides for the features you need. When one feature depends on another, set up the dependency first.

* **[Sandboxes](/langsmith/enable-self-hosted-sandboxes)**: Run isolated code workloads. Its guide covers KVM-capable nodes, JuiceFS storage, and optional service URLs.
* **[Engine](/langsmith/engine-self-hosted)**: Diagnose recurring issues and propose fixes. Engine requires Sandboxes, a license with the Engine entitlement, a model configuration, and Helm chart version 0.16.0 or later. [Air-gapped installations](/langsmith/engine-self-hosted#air-gapped-installations) and your own model providers require Helm chart version 0.17.0 or later.
* **[Fleet](/langsmith/enable-self-hosted-fleet)**: Create and manage no-code agents. Its guide covers Fleet services and optional tools and triggers.
* **[LLM Gateway](/langsmith/llm-gateway-self-hosted)**: Route model calls and apply policies. It requires Helm chart version 0.17.1 or later. Its guide covers service connectivity, provider configuration, and your first gateway call.
* **[LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deploy-self-hosted-full-platform)**: Deploy and manage Agent Servers through the LangSmith UI. Its guide covers KEDA, ingress, the control plane, and the data plane.
