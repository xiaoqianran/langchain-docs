# Permissions

Control filesystem access with declarative permission rules for Deep Agents

Control which files and directories an agent can read or write to using declarative permission rules. Pass a list of rules to `permissions=` and the agent's built-in filesystem tools respect them.

<Note>
  Permissions require `deepagents>=1.9.1`.
</Note>

Permissions only apply to the built-in filesystem tools (`ls`, `read_file`, `glob`, `grep`, `write_file`, `edit_file`). Custom tools and MCP tools that access the filesystem are not covered. Permissions also do not apply to [sandbox backends](/oss/javascript/deepagents/sandboxes), which support arbitrary command execution via the `execute` tool.

<Tip>
  Use `permissions` when you need **path-based allow/deny rules** on the built-in filesystem tools. Use [backend policy hooks](/oss/javascript/deepagents/backends#add-policy-hooks) when you need custom validation logic (rate limiting, audit logging, content inspection) or need to control custom tools.
</Tip>

## Basic usage

Pass a list of `FilesystemPermission` rules to `createDeepAgent`. Rules are evaluated in declaration order. The first matching rule wins. If no rule matches, the operation is allowed.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
const agent = createDeepAgent({
  model,
  backend,
  permissions: [
    {
      operations: ["write"],
      paths: ["/**"],
      mode: "deny",
    },
  ],
});
if (!agent) throw new Error("basic: agent not created");
```

## Rule structure

Each `FilesystemPermission` has three fields:

| Field        | Type                    | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `operations` | `("read" \| "write")[]` | Operations this rule applies to. `"read"` covers `ls`, `read_file`, `glob`, `grep`. `"write"` covers `write_file`, `edit_file`.      |
| `paths`      | `string[]`              | Glob patterns for matching file paths (e.g., `["/workspace/**"]`). Supports `**` for recursive matching and `{a,b}` for alternation. |
| `mode`       | `"allow" \| "deny"`     | Whether to allow or deny matching operations. Defaults to `"allow"`.                                                                 |

Rules use first-match-wins evaluation: the first rule whose `operations` and `paths` match the current call determines the outcome. If no rule matches, the call is **allowed** (permissive default).

Paths must be absolute (start with `/`) and cannot contain `..` or `~`. Invalid paths throw at agent construction time.

## Examples

### Isolate to a workspace directory

Allow reads and writes only under `/workspace/` and deny everything else:

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
const agent = createDeepAgent({
  model,
  backend,
  permissions: [
    {
      operations: ["read", "write"],
      paths: ["/workspace/**"],
      mode: "allow",
    },
    {
      operations: ["read", "write"],
      paths: ["/**"],
      mode: "deny",
    },
  ],
});
if (!agent) throw new Error("isolate-workspace: agent not created");
```

### Protect specific files

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
const agent = createDeepAgent({
  model,
  backend,
  permissions: [
    {
      operations: ["read", "write"],
      paths: ["/workspace/.env", "/workspace/examples/**"],
      mode: "deny",
    },
    {
      operations: ["read", "write"],
      paths: ["/workspace/**"],
      mode: "allow",
    },
    {
      operations: ["read", "write"],
      paths: ["/**"],
      mode: "deny",
    },
  ],
});
if (!agent) throw new Error("protect-files: agent not created");
```

### Read-only memory

Allow the agent to read memory files but prevent it from modifying them. This is useful for organization-wide policies or shared knowledge bases that should only be updated by application code. See [read-only vs writable memory](/oss/javascript/deepagents/memory#read-only-vs-writable-memory) for more context.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
const store = new InMemoryStore();
const agent = createDeepAgent({
  model,
  backend: new CompositeBackend(new StateBackend(), {
    "/memories/": new StoreBackend({
      namespace: (rt) => [rt.serverInfo.user.identity],
    }),
    "/policies/": new StoreBackend({
      namespace: (rt) => [rt.context.orgId],
    }),
  }),
  permissions: [
    {
      operations: ["write"],
      paths: ["/memories/**", "/policies/**"],
      mode: "deny",
    },
  ],
  store,
});
if (!agent) throw new Error("read-only-memory: agent not created");
```

### Deny all access

Block all reads and writes. This is a restrictive baseline you can layer more specific allow rules on top of:

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
const agent = createDeepAgent({
  model,
  backend,
  permissions: [
    {
      operations: ["read", "write"],
      paths: ["/**"],
      mode: "deny",
    },
  ],
});
if (!agent) throw new Error("deny-all: agent not created");
```

### Rule ordering

Because of first-match-wins, rule order matters. Place more specific rules before broader ones:

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
const correctPermissions: FilesystemPermission[] = [
  { operations: ["read", "write"], paths: ["/workspace/.env"], mode: "deny" },
  {
    operations: ["read", "write"],
    paths: ["/workspace/**"],
    mode: "allow",
  },
  { operations: ["read", "write"], paths: ["/**"], mode: "deny" },
];

const incorrectPermissions: FilesystemPermission[] = [
  {
    operations: ["read", "write"],
    paths: ["/workspace/**"],
    mode: "allow",
  },
  {
    operations: ["read", "write"],
    paths: ["/workspace/.env"],
    mode: "deny",
  },
  { operations: ["read", "write"], paths: ["/**"], mode: "deny" },
];
```

## Subagent permissions

[Subagents](/oss/javascript/deepagents/subagents) inherit the parent agent's permissions by default. To give a subagent different permissions, set the `permissions` field in its spec. This **replaces** the parent's rules entirely.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
const agent = createDeepAgent({
  model,
  backend,
  permissions: [
    {
      operations: ["read", "write"],
      paths: ["/workspace/**"],
      mode: "allow",
    },
    { operations: ["read", "write"], paths: ["/**"], mode: "deny" },
  ],
  subagents: [
    {
      name: "auditor",
      description: "Read-only code reviewer",
      systemPrompt: "Review the code for issues.",
      permissions: [
        { operations: ["write"], paths: ["/**"], mode: "deny" },
        { operations: ["read"], paths: ["/workspace/**"], mode: "allow" },
        { operations: ["read"], paths: ["/**"], mode: "deny" },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
if (!agent) throw new Error("subagent: agent not created");
```

To explicitly grant a subagent unrestricted access, set `permissions: []`. An empty array overrides the parent rules with no restrictions. Omitting `permissions` inherits from the parent.

## Composite backends

When using a `CompositeBackend` with a sandbox default, every permission path must be scoped under a known route prefix. Sandboxes support arbitrary command execution, so path-based restrictions alone cannot prevent filesystem access through shell commands. Scoping permissions to route-specific [backends](/oss/javascript/deepagents/backends) avoids this conflict.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
const sandbox = new StateBackend();
const memoriesBackend = new StateBackend();
const composite = new CompositeBackend(sandbox, {
  "/memories/": memoriesBackend,
});
const agent = createDeepAgent({
  model,
  backend: composite,
  permissions: [
    { operations: ["write"], paths: ["/memories/**"], mode: "deny" },
  ],
});
if (!agent) throw new Error("composite-backend: agent not created");
```

Permissions that include paths outside any route throw at construction time:

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
const sandbox = new StateBackend();
const memoriesBackend = new StateBackend();
const composite = new CompositeBackend(sandbox, {
  "/memories/": memoriesBackend,
});

createDeepAgent({
  model,
  backend: composite,
  permissions: [
    { operations: ["write"], paths: ["/workspace/**"], mode: "deny" },
  ],
});

createDeepAgent({
  model,
  backend: composite,
  permissions: [{ operations: ["read"], paths: ["/**"], mode: "deny" }],
});
```
