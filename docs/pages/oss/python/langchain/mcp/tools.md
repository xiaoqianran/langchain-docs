# Tools

Load MCP tools into LangChain agents, control their execution, and handle server results and requests.

<Note>
  The `langchain.mcp` namespace requires `langchain[mcp]>=1.4.0` and is in beta. The API may change.
</Note>

[`MCPAdapter`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/mcp/adapter/MCPAdapter) bridges MCP servers and LangChain agents: it discovers the tools a server advertises and adapts them into standard LangChain tools. Pass the tools from `list_tools()` to [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/factory/create_agent) as you would any other LangChain tool.

This page covers what is specific to that bridge: identifying MCP tools, controlling their execution, handling their outputs, and responding when a server needs input during a call. For the runnable discovery-and-agent example, see the [MCP quickstart](/oss/python/langchain/mcp).

## Use MCP tools in an agent

Discover the server's catalog with [`MCPAdapter.list_tools`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/mcp/adapter/MCPAdapter/list_tools), then give the returned tools to [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/factory/create_agent). From the agent's perspective, they behave like LangChain tools: the model chooses a tool, LangChain invokes it, and the resulting [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain-core/messages/tool/ToolMessage) returns to the model.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.mcp import MCPAdapter


async def run_agent(server) -> dict:
    # Discover the server's tools, then hand them to the agent like any other
    # LangChain tools. The tools hold the client, so the agent stays usable
    # for the life of the adapter context.
    async with MCPAdapter(server) as adapter:
        tools = await adapter.list_tools()
        agent = create_agent("claude-sonnet-5", tools)
        return await agent.ainvoke(
            {
                "messages": [
                    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the forecast for Oslo?"}
                ]
            }
        )
```

## Handle tool outputs

MCP tool results become [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain-core/messages/tool/ToolMessage) objects with content the model can read, an artifact for application data, and a status indicating success or failure.

### Multimodal content

The adapter converts model-visible MCP content into LangChain [content blocks](/oss/python/langchain/messages#standard-content-blocks). For example, a tool that returns an MCP image block with a screenshot reaches the model as an `image` block.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.mcp import MCPAdapter
from langchain.messages import ToolMessage


async def access_multimodal_tool_content(server) -> dict:
    async with MCPAdapter(server) as adapter:
        tools = await adapter.list_tools()
        agent = create_agent("claude-sonnet-5", tools)
        result = await agent.ainvoke(
            {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Take a screenshot."}]}
        )

    # An MCP result arrives as LangChain content blocks. Image and file content
    # convert into standardized `image`/`file` blocks alongside `text`.
    for message in result["messages"]:
        if not isinstance(message, ToolMessage):
            continue
        for block in message.content_blocks:  # [!code highlight]
            if block["type"] == "text":  # [!code highlight]
                print(f"Text: {block['text']}")  # [!code highlight]
            elif block["type"] == "image":  # [!code highlight]
                preview = block.get("base64", "")[:20]  # [!code highlight]
                print(f"Image mime type: {block.get('mime_type')}")  # [!code highlight]
                print(f"Image base64: {preview}...")  # [!code highlight]

    return result
```

### Structured content

When a tool returns structured content, the adapter attaches it to the [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain-core/messages/tool/ToolMessage) as an artifact rather than folding it into the model-visible text. Run the agent, then read the `artifact` from the [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain-core/messages/tool/ToolMessage) instances in the result:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.mcp import MCPAdapter
from langchain.messages import ToolMessage


async def run_agent_structured(server) -> dict:
    async with MCPAdapter(server) as adapter:
        tools = await adapter.list_tools()
        agent = create_agent("claude-sonnet-5", tools)
        result = await agent.ainvoke(
            {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Look up user 42."}]}
        )

    # The adapter sets `artifact` only when the tool returned structured
    # content, so a non-None artifact always carries `structured_content`.
    for message in result["messages"]:
        if isinstance(message, ToolMessage) and message.artifact is not None:
            structured = message.artifact["structured_content"]  # [!code highlight]
            print(f"Structured content: {structured}")  # [!code highlight]

    return result
```

The artifact is an `MCPToolArtifact`, whose `structured_content` field holds the tool result's `structuredContent`. A tool that returns no structured content leaves `artifact` as `None`.

### Errors

An MCP tool result carries an `isError` flag. When a server reports `isError=True`, the adapter converts it into a [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain-core/messages/tool/ToolMessage) with `status="error"` carrying the server's own message, so the agent can read it and correct itself:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.mcp import MCPAdapter
from langchain.messages import ToolMessage


async def divide_by_zero(server) -> dict:
    async with MCPAdapter(server) as adapter:
        tools = await adapter.list_tools()
        agent = create_agent("claude-sonnet-5", tools)
        result = await agent.ainvoke(
            {
                "messages": [
                    {
                        "role": "user",
                        "content": "Use the divide tool to calculate 10 divided by 0.",
                    }
                ]
            }
        )

    # A server error (isError=True) reaches the model as a failed ToolMessage,
    # so the agent can read the server's own message and recover. Transport
    # failures still raise, because a model cannot act on those.
    for message in result["messages"]:
        if isinstance(message, ToolMessage) and message.status == "error":
            print(f"Tool reported: {message.text}")  # [!code highlight]

    return result
```

A server-reported error reaches the model as a failed tool message, but a transport or session failure raises instead.

## Tool metadata

Each adapted tool may carry its MCP provenance under an `mcp` namespace on the LangChain tool's metadata:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
tool.metadata
# {
#     "mcp": {
#         "tool": {
#             "annotations": {
#                 "destructive_hint": True,
#                 "read_only_hint": False,
#             },
#             "_meta": {"origin": "crm"},
#         },
#         "server": {
#             "name": "crm",
#             "version": "2.1.0",
#         },
#     },
# }
```

Every nested field is optional: a server may provide tool annotations, `_meta`, server identity, any combination of those, or none. `annotations` contains MCP hints such as `read_only_hint` and `destructive_hint`; `_meta` is opaque metadata supplied by the server; and `server` identifies the MCP implementation that advertised the tool.

Read optional metadata defensively, so a missing field returns a default rather than failing:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langchain.tools import BaseTool


def is_destructive(tool: BaseTool) -> bool:
    """Read the MCP destructive hint off the adapter's tool metadata."""
    # Chain `.get` with defaults so a tool missing any nested field returns
    # False rather than raising.
    annotations = (
        (tool.metadata or {}).get("mcp", {}).get("tool", {}).get("annotations", {})
    )
    return annotations.get("destructive_hint", False)
```

## Human-in-the-loop

Reading annotations lets you gate a tool based on what the server declares about it, rather than hardcoding tool names. The MCP annotation classifies the tool and LangChain's human-in-the-loop middleware enforces the approval policy.

Read the destructive hint from metadata once during tool discovery. Then give the human-in-the-loop configuration a `when` predicate that receives each pending tool call and returns whether the call needs approval:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import HumanInTheLoopMiddleware
from langchain.agents.middleware.human_in_the_loop import InterruptOnConfig
from langchain.mcp import MCPAdapter
from langchain.tools import BaseTool
from langchain.tools.tool_node import ToolCallRequest
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver


def is_destructive(tool: BaseTool) -> bool:
    """Read the MCP destructive hint from the adapter's tool metadata."""
    annotations = (
        (tool.metadata or {}).get("mcp", {}).get("tool", {}).get("annotations", {})
    )
    return annotations.get("destructive_hint", False)


async def gate_destructive_tools(server):
    async with MCPAdapter(server) as adapter:
        tools = await adapter.list_tools()

        # Read the hint once, then apply the same predicate to every tool call.
        destructive = {tool.name for tool in tools if is_destructive(tool)}
    
        def needs_approval(request: ToolCallRequest) -> bool:
            return request.tool_call["name"] in destructive
    
        gate = InterruptOnConfig(
            allowed_decisions=["approve", "reject"], when=needs_approval
        )
        interrupt_on: dict[str, bool | InterruptOnConfig] = {
            tool.name: gate for tool in tools
        }
        return create_agent(
            "claude-sonnet-5",
            tools,
            middleware=[HumanInTheLoopMiddleware(interrupt_on=interrupt_on)],
            checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),
        )
```

When the agent calls a tool that the predicate gates, the run pauses. Approve the call to run it, or reject it to skip the tool and tell the model:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.types import Command

# Approve the pending destructive call and resume.
resumed = await agent.ainvoke(
    Command(resume={"decisions": [{"type": "approve"}]}), config
)
```

The predicate can also inspect the call's arguments. This lets a tool run freely for safe inputs and pause only for risky ones, such as a `delete_file` call targeting a protected path.

Access the arguments through `request.tool_call["args"]`.

Combine the metadata classification and argument check to gate a tool only when its type and inputs warrant approval. For the full approval workflow, see [Human-in-the-loop](/oss/python/langchain/human-in-the-loop).

## Server requests during tool execution

Most tools finish without asking the client for anything mid-call. When a server needs input, [`MCPAdapter`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/mcp/adapter/MCPAdapter) surfaces [elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/client/elicitation) as a LangGraph [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/interrupt).

### Elicitation

[Elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/client/elicitation) lets an MCP server request input during a tool call. The adapter pauses the run with a LangGraph interrupt. Your application presents the request to the user and resumes the run with their answer.

Attach a [checkpointer](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory) to the agent and use the same `thread_id` when invoking and resuming it.

This example assumes the booking tool asks for one date and pauses once. Replace the sample date with the user's answer.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from typing import Any

from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.mcp import MCPAdapter
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from langgraph.types import Command


async def book_with_elicitation(server) -> dict:
    # When a server needs input mid-call, the adapter surfaces the question
    # as a LangGraph interrupt.
    async with MCPAdapter(server) as adapter:
        tools = await adapter.list_tools()

        # A checkpointer saves the interrupted run so it can resume.
        agent = create_agent("claude-sonnet-5", tools, checkpointer=InMemorySaver())
        config: Any = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "booking-1"}}

        paused = await agent.ainvoke(
            {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Book a table for 4."}]}, config
        )
        [interrupt] = paused["__interrupt__"]
        [question] = interrupt.value["requests"]

        # Answers are keyed by the server's own request key.
        # Use `decline` or `cancel` to refuse the request.
        answer = {"action": "accept", "content": {"date": "2026-09-14"}}
        return await agent.ainvoke(
            Command(resume={"responses": {question["key"]: answer}}), config
        )
```

Elicitation is on by default. The adapter advertises the capability and drives the interrupt loop. A prebuilt client that already carries its own elicitation handler is honored instead of overridden.

Resume with `Command(resume={"responses": {key: answer}})`. The interrupt payload and answer types live in `langchain.mcp.elicitation`.

<Note>
  Resuming reruns the tool from the beginning. Any work performed before the server asks for input can repeat. Make that work safe to repeat without duplicating side effects.
</Note>

Each answer uses one of these actions:

* **`accept`**: Provide form `content` matching the request's schema, or confirm completion of a URL interaction without `content`.
* **`decline`**: Refuse to provide the requested information.
* **`cancel`**: Indicate that the user canceled the interaction.

The adapter forwards the answer to the server, which decides how the tool call finishes.

Only elicitation is answered this way. A server that instead asks for [sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/client/sampling) or [roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/client/roots) raises an error, because the modern, sessionless protocol has no live back-channel for those requests. See [Sampling and roots](/oss/python/migrate/langchain-mcp-adapters#sampling-and-roots).

<Note>
  Interrupt-driven elicitation answers a server that returns its request as an `InputRequiredResult`. A server that only pushes elicitation over a legacy handshake session cannot be answered this way.
